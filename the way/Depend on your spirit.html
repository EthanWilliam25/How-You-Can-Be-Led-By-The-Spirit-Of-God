    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >Depend On Your Spirit</h1>


<p><strong>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</strong></p>


<p><strong>-Mark 11:23-24</strong></p>

<p>Your spirit knows things that your head does not know, because the Holy Spirit is in your spirit.</p>


<p>When medical science gave me up to die as a teenager and said they could do nothing further for me, I knew somehow that if there was help for me anywhere it would be in the Bible.</p>


<p>I started with the New Testament because I knew I didn't have much time. Eventually I came to Mark 11:23 and 24.</p>


<p>When I came to Mark 11:24, something from outside me some-where said to my mind. That doesn't mean what things soever ye desire physically, or materially, or financially. That just means whatsoever things ye desire spiritually. Healing has been done away with.</p>


<p>I tried to get my pastor to come and tell me what Mark 11:24 did mean. He did not come. One preacher finally did come. He patted my hand, put on a professional voice and said, "Just be patient my boy In a few more days it will all be over."</p>


<p>I accepted the verdict and lay there expecting to die. It was two months before I got back into the Bible and back to Mark 11:23 and 24.</p>


<p>I said, "Lord, I tried to get someone to help me and I couldn't. So I am going to tell You what I am going to do. I am just going to take You at Your Word. When You were here on earth, You said it. I am going to believe it. If You didn't lie about it, I am coming off this bed, because I can believe what You said I can believe."</p>


<p>Then I hit on this idea. (It took me a long time because I had limited use of my hands. They propped the Bible in front of me and I just sort of "scooted" the pages.) I decided to run my reference on faith and healing. I came to James 5:14 and 15.</p>


<p><strong>JAMES 5:14-15</strong></p>

<p><strong>14-Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</strong></p>


<p><strong>15-And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</strong></p>

<p>I thought all the rest of the healing scriptures and prayer promises hinged on that--I thought you HAD to call for the elders of the church. (You don't have to you just can if you need to.) So I began to cry, "Dear Lord, if I have to call for the elders of the church to anoint me with oil to be healed, then I can't be healed. I don't know any elders of the church that believe in that."</p>


<p>I had been saved about six months, and I had never heard an inward voice. I am not talking about the voice of the Spirit of God that is more authoritative-I am talking about that still small voice of my spirit.</p>


<p>My spirit said to me, "Did you notice that verse said that the prayer of faith shall save the sick?"</p>


<p>I had to look again. I'd had my mind on the elders and had missed that. "Yes," I said aloud, "that is what it says!" It came as a real shock to me.</p>


<p>Then on the inside of me these words were spoken, "You can pray that prayer as well as anyone can." Hallelujah!</p>

<p>But my spiritual education was slow-just like yours. I stayed in that bed nine more months before I finally saw that I had to believe I received my healing before it would be manifested.</p>


<p>It was while I was praying and saying, "I believe that I receive my healing," that I saw what I must do. I said, "I believe that I receive healing from the top of my head to the soles of my feet." Then I began to praise God because I believed that I received my healing.</p>


<p>Again, on the inside of me, I heard these words this was not that a still small voice, so faint I would not authoritative voice, but just have heard it if my mind and body had been very active "Now you believe that you are well."</p>


<p>I said, "I sure do."</p> 

<p>That inward voice said, "Get up then. Well people ought to be up at 10:30 in the morning."</p>


<p>I had been paralyzed. It was a struggle. I pushed myself, Finally I got up to where I was draped over the bedpost. My knees sagged down not far from the floor. I had no feeling from my waist down But draped over that bedpost I said it again, "I want to announce in the Presence of Almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the, holy angels present in this room, and I want to call the devil to record and all evil spirits that may be present in this room, that according to Mark 11:24, I believe that I receive my healing."</p>


<p>When I said that, physically, I felt something. It felt like someone above me was pouring a pitcher of honey on me. I felt it strike me on the top of my head. It seemed to pile up like honey would, and then it began to ooze down over me. It had a warm glow to it. It spread down over my head, down my neck and shoulders, down my arms and out the ends of my fingers, and down my body and out the ends of my toes.</p>


<p>All of a sudden I was standing straight! I have been straight ever since.</p>


<strong style="text-align: left;">But I want you to see this. I listened to my spirit. Faith is of the spirit. Your faith will not work to its fullest until you learn some of these things. Learn to depend on Him-the One Who is in you. Learn to develop your own spirit. Have faith in the fact that your faith in God works.</strong>
