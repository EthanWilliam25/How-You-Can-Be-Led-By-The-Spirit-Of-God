<p><strong>for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</strong></p>


<p><strong>-2 Corinthians 6:16</strong></p>

<p>If you are born again, the Holy Spirit is living and abiding in I your spirit.</p>

<p>He's living and abiding where? In your head? No. In your body? In a sense, yes, but not exactly in the way we might think. The only reason your body becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit is because your body is the temple of your own spirit. The Holy Spirit abides in your spirit. And He communicates with you through your spirit.</p>

<p>He does not communicate directly with your mind-He is not in your mind. He is in your spirit-He communicates with you through your spirit. Of course, your spirit does reach and influenc your mentality.</p>

<p>Even as a newborn babe in Christ, still bedfast, I would kno things by an inward witness. I knew nothing about being filled wit the Holy Ghost and speaking with other tongues-but I was born of the Spirit. I had the witness of the Spirit right on the inside of me that I was a child of God.</p>

<p>I had been bedfast about four months when my mother came to my bed one day and said, "Son, I hate to bother you, but something is wrong with Dub."</p>


<p>Dub is my oldest brother. He was 17 at the time and he was gone We didn't know exactly where he was.</p>


<p>She sensed something in her spirit. She thought maybe he had got. ten into trouble and was in jail. She said, "I've been praying for him for three days, but I need some help."</p>


<p>I said, "Momma, I thought you already had enough problems with me being bedfast. I've known that myself about Dub for several days He's not in jail, though. It's not that kind of trouble. His physical life is in danger. But I've already prayed, and he will make it. His life will be spared. I've already got the answer."</p>


<p>I didn't know how to get the answer on healing right then-it was a year later before I was healed. But I knew some things, praise God, and God will meet you as far as your faith goes.</p>


<p>Three days later, Dub came home in the nighttime. You see, it was 1933 and there was no work. Men were out on the streets with no jobs in those great Depression Days. Dub had gone down to the Rio Grande Valley to look for work. He didn't find any. So he decided to hop a freight train-lots of people were riding the rails in those days-from the backside of the Valley right on through to McKinney.</p>


<p>About 50 miles south of Dallas a railway detective knocked him in the head and threw him off that train while it was going 50 or 60 miles an hour. He went sailing down the track. They burned coal in those days and they would put the cinders along the track. He hit those cinders and went scooting on his back. It's a wonder it hadn't broken his back. It would have if we hadn't known about it by the inward witness and prayed.</p>


<p>He lay out in the ditch, and then came to after a while. His shirt was completely torn off, and the seat of his britches was torn out, so he could only travel at night. In the daytime he hid out in the trees in the field-it was the time of year he could find fruit-and during the nighttime he walked up the rail toward McKinney. It was night when he got home. Momma put him to bed and he was all right in a few days.</p>


<p>Momma and I were not Spirit-filled Christians-but we were Christians. And we had a witness in our spirits that something was wrong-an inward intuition. This is something every Christian ought to have. It is something every Christian should develop. We should develop our spirits.</p>


<p>In less than 10 years' time a Full Gospel minister friend of mine was in three serious automobile accidents. People were killed. His wife was almost killed. He was seriously injured. Cars were demol-ished. But they were both healed by the mercy of God.</p>


<p>He heard me teach along some of these lines and he said to me, "Brother Hagin, every one of those accidents could have been avoided if I had listened to that inward intuition."</p>


<p>Yet in similar instances people will say, "I don't know why that happened to such a good Christian. He's a preacher." (Preachers have to learn to listen to their spirits just like you have to learn to listen to your spirit.) Then they lay it off on God and say that God did it.</p>

<p>This preacher said to me, "If I had listened to that inward some. thing I just had an intuition that something was about to happen-1 would have waited a little bit and prayed. Instead I thought, I'm busy. I don't have time to pray."</p>


<p>Many times, if we would have waited, God would have shown us. We could have avoided many things. But let's not moan and groan about past failures. Let's just take advantage of what is ours and see to it that it doesn't happen again. We can do nothing about what is past anyhow. Let's begin to develop our spirits, and learn to listen to them.</p>


<p>The Holy Spirit is abiding in your spirit. It is your spirit that picks up these things from the Holy Spirit and then passes them on to your mind by an inward intuition, or inward witness.</p>


<p>Jesus said, <strong>"... If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him"</strong> (John 14:23). In this passage of scripture, Jesus is talking about the Holy Spirit's coming. Jesus and the Father in the Person of the Holy Spirit come to abide in us. An abode is the place where one lives. Another translation says, "We will come unto him, and make our home with him."</p>


<p>The Holy Spirit, through the Apostle Paul said, <em>"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"</em> (1 Cor. 3:16). Another translation says, "The Spirit of God is at home in you." That's where He lives in you!</p>


<p>The Bible says,<strong>"... for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people"</strong>(2 Cor. 6:16).</p>

<p>Put those three scriptures together:</p>

<p><strong>JOHN 14:23; 1 CORINTHIANS 3:16; 2 CORINTHIANS 6:16</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</strong></p>

<p>We have never yet plumbed the depth of what God is really saying: "I will dwell in them. I will live in them. I will walk in them." If God is dwelling in us-and He is then that is where He will speak to us.</p>
