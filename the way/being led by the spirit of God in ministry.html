<p><strong>The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."</strong></p>


<p><strong>-1 Samuel 16:7</strong></p>


<p>[This appendix has been compiled and edited from transcripts of messages Brother Hagin preached during Kenneth Hagin Ministries' Campmeeting in Tulsa, Okla-homa, the evenings of July 28 and 30, 1988.-Ed.]</p>



<p>In 1943 and 1944, I was pastor of a small church in Farmersville in north central Texas. One Mother's Day, I'd been asked to speak at another church at a special Sunday afternoon service. That meant I had to miss the morning service at my own church. So, we told our church that we'd have our Mother's Day service that evening. (We had the largest crowds in the evening services, anyway.)</p>

<p>Since it was May, it was warm enough that the windows and doors were open, and sometimes we had more people outside than inside.</p>


<p>I'd worked for weeks on my Mother's Day sermon, and it was a good one, too what we used to call a "stem-winder." I had my notes, I had scriptures, and I had quotes from Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, and others. I was ready.</p>


<p>During the service, some of the youth and children gave a recita-tion about mothers and every song honored mothers. Everything was about mothers.</p>



<p>As I sat there while a trio of young ladies sang the last song before I was to preach, the Spirit of God said to me, "As soon as they get through singing, get up and have a healing service."</p>


<p>I said, "Dear Lord, they'll think I'm nuts. This is Mother's Day. Don't you understand? There's been nothing said about healing. The whole service has been about mothers." I never did know what that trio was singing, because I was having an argument between my head and my heart. (You see, the Spirit of God doesn't dwell in your head. He dwells in your heart, in your spirit. He doesn't speak to your head. He speaks to you in your spirit-in your innermost being.)</p>



<p>I looked over the crowd. Several men there had come only because their children were part of the program. I thought, These men won't be back in church until Christmas. I can preach about mothers and get a little sentimental, and they might come forward and get saved.</p>


<p>When the time came for my sermon, I stepped up to the pulpit, pulled out my notes, and read my text. But I couldn't go any further. I closed my Bible and said, "Folks, I have to obey God." And we had a powerful healing service!</p>


<p>An older man in the congregation could not walk upright. When I laid hands on him, the power of God hit him and straightened him up immediately.</p>

<p>He bent over backward and touched the floor. He bent over forward and touched the floor. He went through all kinds of gymnastics. Normally, a man his age-he was about 69 couldn't have done that. When other people in the congregation saw it, they were encouraged, and they started getting healed!</p>


<p>I looked toward the back and saw all the men who had come to see their children-the ones I thought would never be back if I didn't preach about mothers. They were sitting there weeping. God had touched them. He knew how to reach them. And many of those men came back the next week!</p>


<p>A lot of times, we preachers think we know what needs to happen because we've got our program all arranged. The Holy Spirit will try to move in a service, but He can't because we're trying to push our program.</p>


<p>Now, having a sermon outline is good. And staying with it is all right if it's necessary. But if the Holy Ghost leads you to do something else, do it! Have you ever noticed that sometimes God doesn't work in ways we think He ought to? We'd like it if God told us His whole plan from the start, wouldn't we? It would be a lot easier on our flesh and minds if He did.</p>


<p>The Prophet Samuel had to deal with this issue when the Lord told him to anoint a new king of Israel. Let's look at part of the account in First Samuel chapter 16:</p>


<p><strong>1 SAMUEL 16:1,4-13</strong></p>


<p><strong>1-And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons..</strong></p>

<p><strong>4-And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</strong></p>


<p><strong>5-And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6-And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>7-But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his coun-tenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</strong></p>

<p><strong>8-Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>9-Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>10-Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11-And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy chil-dren? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</strong></p>

<p><strong>12-And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</strong></p>

<p><strong>13-Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</strong></p>


<p>Why didn't God tell Samuel, "Go anoint David"? Why go through the elimination process? Why did God tell Samuel who the next king wouldn't be instead of who he would be?</p>


<p>Samuel was as human as the rest of us. He was trying to make a logical choice among Jesse's sons. He thought the oldest must be the one. But the Lord told Samuel, "Look not on his countenance... for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (v. 7). If the Lord looked on our outward appearance, a lot of us would be in a mess.</p>


<p>Once, while holding meetings in Kansas, I spent an afternoon alone in prayer about the meetings. During that time, I began think-ing about my personal faults and failures, and mistakes I'd made in the past. As I did, I got embarrassed. I said, "Lord, I'm almost embarrassed to stand in your presence."Then I started listing occasions when I had made mistakes or missed His direction in different circumstances.</p>


<p>His response startled me. His Voice was as real to me as if someone were standing in the same room with me. I even looked around to see if someone was there. He said, "I know you missed it. But I was looking on your heart all the time. I wasn't looking at the outward man." That's when He showed me First Samuel 16:7. He continued, "Even though you've made mistakes, your heart has always been right toward Me."That blessed me!</p>


<p>So as Samuel observed each of Jesse's sons, God kept saying, "No, not him." I imagine Samuel started to wonder if he had missed God in going to Jesse's house. So he asked Jesse, "Do you have any more sons?"</p>


<p>Some people think prophets know everything. But that's not the case. We as ministers don't know everything, either.</p>

<p>All we know is what God tells us. Often during a service, God has told me there's someone present He wants to minister to. A few times He has also told me who it is. But that's the exception, not the rule. Samuel knew only what God had told him that one of Jesse's sons would be the next king of Israel.</p>


<p>Why doesn't God tell us the whole story all at once? Because if He were to tell us everything about our situations, we'd be walking by sight and not by faith. And if we don't walk by faith, we can't please Him (Heb. 11:6). That's the reason He didn't tell Samuel at the start which of Jesse's sons to anoint as king.</p>


<p>The pianist in our church in Farmersville had a tumor in her left lung as big as a man's fist. She hadn't asked us to pray, and she hadn't gotten in a healing line. But as I concluded the service one Sunday morning, the Lord told me, "There's a woman here I want to heal before you go today."</p>


<p>Now if I had hesitated, I would have thought, Well, if there's a woman He wants to heal, doesn't He know who it is? I would have dismissed the service and missed God. And this dear sister might not have received her healing.</p>


<p>Before I had time to think, I said, "The Lord wants to heal a woman here this morning."</p>


<p>A lady stepped out of the congregation and started walking toward the front. In my spirit-in what we call the still small voice-I heard, "She's not the one." So I said to this woman, "Sister, you're not the one He's talking about. But come on down, because healing belongs to you. I'll pray for you and lay my hands on you."</p>


<p>About that time, the pianist stepped out. The Holy Spirit said to me, "She's the one." So I laid hands on her and prayed.</p>


<p>The following Tuesday, she went back to the hospital for treat-ments. After a few X-rays, the doctors told her the tumor was completely gone!</p>

<p>You see, God wants us to walk by faith. He will lead us one step at a time, and each step requires faith. Sometimes, we think he's lead-ing us in one direction based on the last step He told us to take. Bur 1 actually that step was to position us to go in another direction. Pastors, evangelists, and laymen-all of us need to understand this principle.</p>


<p><strong><h3>How God Led Us to Tulsa, Oklahoma</h3></strong></p>


<p>[In Chapter 11 of this book, Brother Hagin relates how the Lord let him know that He wanted him to move his offices to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here, Rev. Hagin provides further details of that move.-Ed.]</p>



<p>The Lord had told me that He wanted us to move our offices to Tulsa and that He would give us Brother T.L. Osborn's former office building. A while later, He awakened me one morning at sunrise and told me to go see a certain businessman in Tulsa. Now, I knew this man had money, but I wasn't about to ask him for money. I'd never asked anyone for money personally, and I wasn't about to start.</p>


<p>So, Oretha and I drove to Oklahoma City on business. While we were there, I called this businessman and we agreed to meet him and his wife for dinner in Tulsa. So we met them, and had dinner. I never said anything to him about moving to Tulsa or what God had told us about Brother Osborn's building.</p>


<p>As we left the restaurant with this couple, another couple, long-time friends (he later became one of our board members) drove up to have dinner at the same restaurant. They shook hands with the couple we had just eaten with, and then that couple got in their car and left. Then the couple who had just arrived invited us to eat with them. We thanked them for the offer but said we had just had dinner.</p>


<p>"Well, come and drink a glass of tea or something," they said. So we went back into the restaurant with them.</p>


<p>While we were talking, I said (almost jokingly) that we might move to Tulsa into T.L. Osborn's old offices. The man spoke briefly with his wife, pulled out his checkbook, and handed me a check for $1,000 to help us make the move.</p>


<p>"Oh, no, no, no," I said. "We're just thinking about this. We probably won't do it."</p>


<p>The man said, "Take it. God's been talking to us about giving you that money. Use it for whatever you want."</p>


<p>"In that case," I said, "I'll take it. Thank you."</p>


<p>Before we left Tulsa, we went to a shopping center to buy a few things. While we were there, I saw a man I had met through the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship. Again, I mentioned in passing that we might move to Tulsa.</p>


<p>He said, "We'll give you $1,000 toward your move."</p>


<p>I had to call another man I knew, and I mentioned about Brother Osborn's building, and he said, "Put me down for $1,000."</p>


<p>When we got back to the house where we were staying and told that couple what was happeninig, the husband said,"put me down for $1000."</p>


<p>Within a few days, I had spoken with a couple of other bussinessmen about the move and the finances already offered. They each said, "Put me down for $1000."</p>


<p>Before I knew it, I had $7,000 either in hand or promised in support of our move to Tulsa. God just put that together. It was the easiest thing in the world.</p>


<p>My point is that if I had never gone to Tulsa to meet with the man God told me to meet with the one who didn't give us money at that time I wouldn't have run into that second couple who did give us money.</p>

<p>Many times when God leads us, things don't go the way we think they will. But we need to let God lead us step by step, and walk in faith.</p>


<p><strong><h3>Don't Be Ashamed to Back Up</h3></strong></p>


<p>In 1951, I was preaching in Oklahoma at a regional meeting for a Pentecostal denomination. At the end of a particular session, the Lord told me to call a certain businessman to the front and lay hands on him, and He would fill him with the Holy Ghost. I knew this man. He was well known in the community, but he wasn't Pentecostal. He was a member of a Nazarene church.</p>


<p>As well known as this man was, I didn't want to call him out by name. So I said, "If anyone wants to be filled with the Holy Spirit, come down to the front, and I'll lay hands on you, and you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost."</p>


<p>Two or three came down, but the businessman did not. I came off the platform and laid hands on those who responded. But it was like laying hands on a doorknob. Nothing happened. No one got any-thing spiritually, because I had missed God. He didn't tell me to call everyone down. He told me to lay hands on a specific person.</p>


<p>So I backed up. I returned to the platform and told the people, "Folks, I missed God. I need to back up. Forgive me." I then called this man down to the front, and before I was actually able to lay my hands on him, he threw his hands up and started speaking in tongues!</p>


<p>Too often, we ministers are so afraid of admitting that we've missed God that we continue down the wrong path rather than backing up, making the correction, and moving on. As you minister, if you feel like you've lost the anointing, don't be ashamed to back up and correct yourself!</p>


<p><strong><h3>Being Led by the Spirit in the Operation of Spiritual Gifts</h3></strong></p>


<p>Often, while I'm praying over an evening service, the Lord gives me no particular direction for my message. In fact, He has said, "Don't spend time getting together a sermon. Just wait on Me. Whatever is needed in the service, I'll pull it up out of your spirit." You see, I've been putting the Word into my spirit for all the years I've been in ministry, just like you put things into a computer. So the Lord has something He can draw out. That's why many times I don't know which direction the service is going until the singers are through with praise and worship.</p>


<p>Now, I'm just as human as you are, and I'd like to know ahead of time what the Lord wants to do in a service. Many times, He doesn't let me know. But the Holy Spirit lives in me, and I trust Him to give me what's needed for a particular service.</p>


<p>In relation to that, let's consider the following verse from First Corinthians chapter 3:</p>


<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 3:16</strong></p>


<p><strong>16-Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</strong></p>


<p>We've emphasized the fact, and it's scriptural, that God's Spirit dwells in us individually. But we need to understand more fully that it is also true that God's Spirit dwells in us collectively in a local congregation, in a meeting, and in the whole Body of Christ. God's Spirit dwells in every believer individually, and in every body of believers collectively.</p>


<p>Solomon built a physical temple or house for God in the Old Testa-ment. Today, we are spiritual dwellings of the Spirit of God. And since we are spiritual beings and houses, we need spiritual gifts.</p>


<p>As I traveled from church to church early in my traveling minis-try, I noticed that I was able to operate in the spiritual gifts in some churches more than in others. In one church, I would prophesy have a word of knowledge. In other churches, as many as seven of the nine gifts or manifestations of the Spirit mentioned in First Cor-inthians chapter 12 would be in evidence. But in some churches, I wouldn't do anything but teach.</p>


<p><strong><h3>Finally, I asked the Lord, "Why is this?"</h3></strong></p>


<p>He took me to First Corinthians 14:1, where Paul encouraged the church at Corinth to "desire spiritual gifts." He then told me that this epistle was not written to an individual person. Rather, it was written to a whole group of people collectively. Paul was telling the whole church body at Corinth to desire spiritual gifts. And if they would desire them, the Holy Spirit would distribute the gifts to individuals among the congregation as He willed.</p>


<p>The Lord told me that in order for spiritual gifts to manifest in a church, that church must first believe in spiritual gifts, and then they must desire them! (Here again, we see the truth of Hebrews 11:6 that without faith, it is impossible to please God.).</p>


<p>People need to know more about spiritual gifts. When they see what God's Word says about spiritual gifts, they can believe in them and receive the benefits of those gifts operating in their lives.</p>


<p><strong><h3>The Leading of the Holy Spirit</h3></strong></p>


<p>People have asked me what I mean when I say that I have a lead-ing of the Holy Spirit to minister to an individual. Well, the best way I can explain it is like this: imagine a string tied to your spirit, not your body, that's pulling you in a particular direction.</p>


<p>During a time of ministry, you'll feel as though that "string" is pulling you toward someone.</p>


<p>This has happened to me many times. When I get to that person, I lay hands on them. Although I may not know any specific informa-tion about the person or their situation, when I lay hands on them, I know exactly what the problem is.</p>


<p>Another method the Spirit of God uses to lead me is by giv-ing me what I call a "mini-vision." Sometimes before a service or time of ministry, in my spirit, I'll see myself doing something such as laying hands on a particular person or praying for a situation. When the time comes in the service, I'll do what I saw myself do in that vision.</p>


<p>Jesus operated in a similar way.</p>


<p><strong>JOHN 5:19</strong></p>


<p><strong>19-Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, ver-ily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but WHAT HE SEETH THE FATHER DO: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</strong></p>


<p><strong><h3>The Local Church's Role</h3></strong></p>


<p>We need to understand that Jesus Christ, as the Head of the Church (His Body), wants to do the same thing through His spiritual body that He did through His natural body. That's why He needs you.</p>


<p>The Apostle Paul said, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular" (1 Cor. 12:27). Christ is the Head. We're the Body. This refers to the universal Church. Every born-again believer is a mem-ber of that Body. But when a local group of believers meets together, they, in effect, become a body of Christ. They become a temple-God's sanctuary.</p>

<p>Look at this verse in the Amplified translation of First Corinthians chapter 3:</p>


<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 3:16 (Amplified)</strong></p>


<p><strong>16-Do you not discern and understand that you [the whole church at Corinth] are God's temple (His sanctu-ary), and that God's Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [to be at home in you, collectively as a church and also individually]?</strong></p>


<p>We as individuals are temples for the Holy Spirit, but when we come together locally, we collectively become a temple of God for that meeting. Too often all eyes are on the preacher in a service. How-ever, there is great power in a group of believers in agreement.</p>


<p>We've seen a lot of people in wheelchairs delivered. There were three in one night. No one laid hands on them, but the Glory of God was present. They jumped up and started walking. Some people say, "Oh, I wish we'd have more of that." We could if congregations would hook up spiritually with the minister. Doubt and unbelief in a congregation can hinder the work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus encountered that in Mark chapter 6.</p>


<p><strong>MARK 6:1-6</strong></p>


<p><strong>1-And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</strong></p>


<p><strong>2-And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3-Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</strong></p>


<p><strong>4-But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5-AND HE COULD THERE DO NO MIGHTY WORK, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6-And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</strong></p>


<p>Jesus was able to do no mighty work in his own hometown because the people did not believe. So, what did He do? The same thing we as ministers should do-teach. As people's understanding of the operation of the Holy Spirit increases, their ability to believe in those manifestations increases, and so does their ability to receive. No pastor, minister, evangelist, or prophet can do more than the congregation will let him do.</p>


<p>When I was ministering in Oklahoma one time, a 72-year-old woman who had been confined to a wheelchair for four years came down during the healing portion of the service. Three of the best doctors in the state had examined her and said she would never walk again. Before I could lay hands on her, she started crying out loudly.</p>


<p>"Wait a minute, sister," I said, "I have a word from God for you."</p>


<p>The Spirit of God inspired me to say that. But she continued wailing at the top of her lungs. Every time I tried to quiet her down, she just got louder-yelling at the top of her voice. She sounded like a freight train going through a tunnel. Finally, I stood right in front of her and hollered, "I command you in Jesus' Name: shut up!" She finally calmed down.</p>

<p>Why did I do that to a 72-year-old woman? I had to be louder than she was to get her attention. With all of her yelling, she couldn't hear that God had something for her.</p>


<p>Now the congregation didn't understand what I was doing. They thought I was being rude to the woman. So they unhooked spiritu-ally. I couldn't minister to that woman because the congregation had put the brakes on.</p>


<p>So I stopped and spent a few minutes teaching explaining to the congregation what I had just done. Many of them understood and lifted their spiritual feet off the brakes. I could actually sense it in my spirit. And the service moved forward. In less than 10 minutes, that dear woman who the doctors said would never walk again started leaping and jumping all over the front of the church, totally healed! But if I hadn't been able to get enough people in the congregation in agree-ment with me, I never could have ministered to her.</p>


<p>In my field ministry meetings, I was used to seeing 60 percent or more of the people healed and sometimes nine people out of 10. But in one meeting, I knew that not even 10 percent of the people were being healed.</p>


<p>I went to God about it. I fasted and prayed a couple of days. And I asked the Lord where I was missing it. The Lord said, "It's not you. There's too much unbelief in the crowd. You won't see anybody get healed there." Then He reminded me of several instances when He had to change the surroundings before He could minister healing to someone. One instance was in Mark chapter 7:</p>


<p><strong>MARK 7:32-35</strong></p>


<p><strong>32-And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>33-And HE TOOK HIM ASIDE FROM THE MULTI-TUDE, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</strong></p>

<p><strong>34-And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</strong></p>

<p><strong>35-And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</strong></p>


<p>The Lord asked me, "Why do you think I took him aside from the multitude?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said. "I always wondered."</p>


<p>The Lord said, "I couldn't heal him in that multitude. There was too much unbelief there."</p>


<p>Now, it's different when you are in a place, on the mission field for example, where there's no local congregation putting the brakes on. But for the most part, local church congregations in America know enough that their faith affects the success of someone trying to pray for the sick. In churches that were consistently taught about spiritual gifts, I always have complete freedom to minister as God leads me. </p>




<p><strong><h2>A Word From the Lord to Ministers</h2></strong></p>

<p><strong>The time is now. The day has arrived. You're already on the edge of it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now, walk on. Do not look back. Make the necessary dedication and consecration.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Walk on. Walk in the power of God. Minister in the power of God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And all that I've said unto you will surely come to pass. None of it will fail, for the Lord has decreed it. The Lord has ordained it for these last days.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And because it is the time of the end times and certain things have been fulfilled, other things will shortly be fulfilled fulfilled in the natural world and fulfilled in your own life and ministry.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And it shall come to pass at last, and thou shalt rejoice and be glad.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For the Lord has spoken, and no demon, devil, or Satan himself, and certainly not humankind, will be able to stop it, for the Lord is moving.</strong></p>
