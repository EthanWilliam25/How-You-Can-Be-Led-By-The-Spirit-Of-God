    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >Being Led By The Spirit Of God In Prayer</h1>

<p><strong>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints</strong></p>


<p><strong>-Ephesians 6:18</strong></p>


<p>[This appendix has been compiled and edited from transcripts of morning mes-sages Brother Hagin preached during All Faiths' Crusades in Lakeland, Florida, January 22, 2003, and Murrieta, California, March 10 and 11, 2003.-Ed.]</p>



<p>In teaching on the subject of prayer for more than 50 years, I have Lalways used two texts: John 15:7 and Ephesians 6:18. There are no better texts than these for teaching on the subject of prayer, because they are all-inclusive. Anything you want to know about prayer is found in these two verses.</p>

<p>Notice what Jesus said in John chapter 15, verse 7:</p>

<p><strong>JOHN 15:7</strong></p>


<p><strong>7-If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</strong></p>


<p>That's a marvelous text, isn't it? It tells you how to get your prayers answered every time: "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you You see, if you pray according to the Word, your prayers will work. So many times, we're not praying according to the Word. We're in the dark if we don't know what the Word says. But the entrance of God's Word gives light (Ps. 119:130).</p>


<p>Take time to meditate on the Word until it gets in you. Then, you'll ask what you will, and it shall be done for you.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Praying in the Spirit</h2></strong></p>

<p>The other verse I like to use when I teach on prayer is Ephesians 6:18. Paul wrote this letter to Spirit-filled Christians at the church of Ephesus.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 6:18</strong></p>


<p><strong>18-Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all persever-ance and supplication for all saints..</strong></p>


<p>The Amplified Bible translates the first part of the verse this way: "Pray at all times (on every occasion, in every season) in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty." What does it mean to pray in the Spirit? In First Corinthians chapter 14, we have instructions on this subject.</p>

<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 14:2</strong></p>


<p><strong>2-For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</strong></p>


<p>"He that speaketh in an unknown tongue" is talking to God. Well, that's prayer, isn't it? One definition of prayer is fellowshipping with the Father. Therefore, Paul is talking about prayer here. The second part of the verse says, "For no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries." Paul is talking about praying in the Spirit. He's talking about praying in tongues.</p>


<p>The last part of the verse tells us that a person who prays in the Spirit "speaketh mysteries." What does that mean? Well, the mystery isn't with God, because God knows everything. The mystery is with us. We don't know everything. Often, we don't know how to pray for a situation unless the Lord shows us or gives us revelation. We don't know what to pray for as we ought. But thank God, the Holy Ghost knows. He will help us pray if we'll allow Him.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Being Led by the Spirit in Prayer</h2></strong></p>


<p>Many of us haven't taken advantage of being led by the Spirit in prayer. Sometimes we run out of things to pray in English. After a while, we've said everything we know to say. If we stop at that point, our prayer life will be limited by what we know. But remember, God knows everything. He knows what we don't know. He wants to help us pray. And praying in the Spirit will get the job done when nothing else will.</p>


<p>Let's look at what First Corinthians chapter 14 tells us about prayingin the Spirit.</p>

<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 14:14</strong></p>


<p><strong>14-For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</strong></p>


<p>In this verse Paul says that if we pray in an unknown tongue, our spirit prays. The Amplified Bible says, "My spirit [by the Holy Spirit within me] prays." In other words, it's the Holy Ghost Who gives utterance to my spirit, but it's my spirit that actually does the praying.</p>


<p>You see, it isn't all my spirit, and it isn't all the Holy Spirit. It's both of them, working together. The Holy Spirit gives our spirit utterance, so we can pray out of our spirit, not out of our head. That's what it means to be led by the Spirit in prayer.</p>


<p>We need to learn to be led by the Spirit! And praying in other tongues provides a way for you to pray for things that you wouldn't otherwise know needed prayer. Look again at Ephesians chapter 6, verse 18.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 6:18</strong></p>


<p><strong>18-PRAYING ALWAYS WITH ALL PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION IN THE SPIRIT, and watching there-unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints...</strong></p>


<p>Greek scholars tell us that according to the original Greek manu-scripts, the first part of this verse literally says, "praying, being led by the Spirit."</p>


<p>Of course, that phrase includes the idea of praying in tongues, but it also means the Holy Ghost will lead you in how to pray. He may lead you differently at different times.</p>

<p>Although two situations may look the same, the Holy Spirit may lead you to pray one way one time and another way another time. We may not always know why He's leading us to pray a certain way.</p>


<p>The important thing is to follow the leading of the Spirit. He'll show you the best way to pray concerning your situation. Look to Him to lead you in how to pray in every instance. He'll lead you in the right direction.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Why Do We Need to Pray?</h2></strong></p>



<p>Some people may ask why we need to pray. They may be thinking, "God already knows everything. Doesn't God already know what I need?" Yes, He does know. But you still need to pray. Let me explain why.</p>


<p>At the time of Creation, God made the world and the fullness thereof, the silver,the gold, the cattle on a thousand hills, and every thing that's here on earth. Then He made His man, Adam. And God said,"Adam, I give you dominion over all the work of My hands." Adam had dominion over the whole world (Gen.1:26-28).</p>

    
    
<p>But Adam committed high treason. He sold out to Satan. And the Word of God tells us in Second Corinthians 4:4 that Satan is the god of this world. How did he get to be the god of this world? When Adam committed high treason, he gave his dominion to Satan. 'Satan is dominating in this world because Adam sold out.</p>


<p>Thank God, Jesus came and restored us to dominance. Why, then, do we need to pray? I'll give you three references that at least imply our need to pray.</p>


<p>In Matthew chapter 6, verses 5 through 15, Jesus is teaching on the subject of prayer. Look at what He said in verse 8:</p>

<p><strong>MATTHEW 6:8</strong></p>


<p><strong>8... your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</strong></p>


<p>Well, if your Heavenly Father knows what you need, why doesn't He just send it? Why would you have to ask Him? Verse 8 makes it clear that Jesus expects us to ask the Father for what we need. This scripture implies that God will not send what you need unless you do ask Him.</p>


<p>Now look at Matthew chapter 9. Here, again, Jesus is giving instructions on the subject of prayer.</p>


<p><strong>MATTHEW 9:35-38</strong></p>


<p><strong>35-And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gos-pel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>36-But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shep-herd.</strong></p>

<p><strong>37-Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</strong></p>

<p><strong>38-Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</strong></p>



<p>I want to ask you a question. Who does the harvest belong to? Is it God's harvest? Yes! Is He the Lord of the harvest? Yes! Does He want laborers? Yes!</p>


<p>If He wants laborers, why doesn't He send them? What need would there be for us to ask Him if He wants to send them anyway? Yet Jesus clearly tells us that we are to pray to the Father to send laborers. This scripture implies that God will not send them unless we ask Him.</p>


<p>Now, look at these verses from Matthew chapter 18.</p>


<p><strong>MATTHEW 18:18-19</strong></p>


<p><strong>18-Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind ON EARTH shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose ON EARTH shall be loosed in heaven.</strong></p>

<p><strong>19-Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree ON EARTH as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</strong></p>


<p>Notice that Jesus is telling us to do something here on earth. He's telling us to pray. You see, something has to happen on earth before Heaven moves. Verse 19 tells us what has to happen on earth: "If two of you on earth shall agree as touching anything they ASK." They have to ask! They have to pray!</p>


<p><strong><h2>Praying Through</h2></strong></p>


<p>There must be action on the earth before Heaven moves. So you can see that the Holy Ghost is looking for people who have dedicated themselves to prayer. We sometimes call these people "prayer war-riors." People who give themselves to prayer often sense the Spirit of God moving throughout the earth as He tries to find somebody He can use to pray things out!</p>


<p>Why? Because somebody's got to pray about it. Somebody has to pray it out! Do you know what I mean by "praying something out"?</p>


<p>The old-time Pentecostals called this practice "praying through." When you have what some people call a leading-when you have an urge or burden to pray-what do you do? You pray! And when you don't know what you're praying for, you pray in tongues, speak-ing mysteries, speaking divine secrets as First Corinthians chapter 14 tells us.</p>


<p>"Praying through" simply means that you keep praying until you have a note of victory. What do I mean by a note of victory? Well, after you've prayed for a while, you'll begin to laugh or sing to your-self in tongues. You see, a while ago, you had this burden. You felt this heaviness. Then you prayed. And suddenly, you feel as though the burden is gone. You have a sense of gladness. Those signs tell you that you have prayed the situation through and have the victory!</p>


<p><strong><h2>The Importance of Praying Through</h2></strong></p>


<p>When you have a burden or leading to pray, it's important to yield to that leading and pray until you've prayed through. When you do, you'll experience victory.</p>


<p>Years ago, I read the testimony of a missionary named Brother Boley in a Full Gospel magazine. Later, I had the opportunity to hear him preach in a church in Dallas. In his message, he reiterated his testimony.</p>


<p>Brother Boley and his wife went out as missionaries to Africa in the early 1920s. They went inland, into the very heart of Africa, and built a mission there for a native tribe.</p>


<p>One day, a neighboring tribe kidnapped a six-year-old girl from the tribe he was ministering to. Brother Boley knew the customs of the local tribes. He said, "We knew that if we didn't get the little girl back before sundown, we would never recover her. I got a native man who was saved and could speak the dialect of that tribe. And we went over there.</p>


<p>"Before we got there, we could smell this awful smell. They had a custom of taking an animal and killing it. Four or five women of the tribe had to prepare it. Then, they'd hang this animal on a pole at the entrance to the tribe's land. Everyone who came in had to take a knife, cut a piece off that meat, and eat it. If you didn't eat, the women who had prepared the meat would be killed."</p>


<p>In that hot, humid climate, the meat had putrefied. Brother Boley told his interpreter, "We'll have to eat a bite of that. We don't want those women to be killed. Jesus said, 'One of the signs that'll follow believers is that if they drink any deadly thing, it'll not hurt them.' I supposed that we could also eat any deadly thing, and it would not hurt us. So we said, 'In the Name of Jesus. Then, we cut a chunk off that rotten, putrefied meat. We each ate a bite, and it never affected us in any way.</p>


<p>"We made a deal with the chief of that tribe," Brother Boley said.</p>


<p>"We traded him a bunch of trinkets and beads and things for the girl. But then night overtook us."</p>


<p>Because it was dangerous to travel the jungle at night, Brother Boley and his interpreter stayed overnight in the tribe's guest hut. At midnight, they were awakened by the sound of drums. The inter-preter told Brother Boley, "That means we're dead. That's the death knell. It's dawned on the chief that they don't have to give up the girl. They can just kill us and take her back."</p>


<p>The two men heard the tribe members moving around outside the hut. Knowing they were about to die, they committed themselves into God's hands and then stepped outside. Brother Boley said, "I shut my eyes and waited. I know it was just a few seconds, but it seemed like a long time. Nothing happened.</p>


<p>"I heard strange sounds, and when I opened my eyes and looked, the warriors were on the ground! And they were bowing up and down, their knives laying on the ground!"</p>


<p>Brother Boley asked his interpreter what the warriors were saying. The man responded, "They're worshipping you. They think you're a god. They say that when you stepped out of the hut, two giant men in white apparel with a giant sword in either hand stepped out right beside you."</p>


<p>Thank God for His deliverance! But that's not the end of the story. There's more to it.</p>


<p>Soon after his miraculous deliverance, Brother Boley went to check on a lady who was manning a missions station for another local tribe. When he arrived, the woman asked him, "Brother Boley, did some-thing happen to you last Monday night about midnight?"</p>


<p>He said, "Why do you ask?"</p>


<p>"Well," she said, "I always work 14 to 16 hours a day, and I was very tired that Monday, so I got to bed and went to sleep. I was awakened with a burden to pray. I lay there in bed and began to pray. But I was so sleepy, I fell back to sleep. I was awakened again. And I had the same burden to pray! So I prayed, but I was so weary that I fell back to sleep. I was awakened the third time about 10:30 that night, and I decided to get up because I knew if I lay there, I'd go back to sleep."</p>


<p>The woman got out of bed, got on her knees, and said, "Lord, I don't know what it is you've awakened me to pray for. I don't know who it is who needs prayer. I just trust the Holy Ghost to give me utterance." And she began to pray in other tongues. She prayed approximately an hour and a half in other tongues.</p>


<p>"While I was praying," she told Brother Boley, "your face kept flashing before me. I don't know whether I was praying for you or not. At midnight, I knew I had prayed through. I began to laugh. I began to laugh in the Spirit and sing! The burden lifted. Instead of a spirit of heaviness, I felt a spirit of lightness."</p>

<p>The night she prayed was the same night Brother Boley was delivered from death. It was a mystery to her why she was awakened to pray, but it wasn't a mystery to God! What if she hadn't prayed? Thank God, she did!</p>


<p>You can see the necessity of following that leading to pray, even though we don't know what it is we're praying for. Afterward, we sometimes find out what we were praying for. Sometimes, we'll never know until we get to Heaven. But how important it is that we respond to the Holy Spirit when He leads us to pray!</p>


<p><strong><h2>When the Spirit Leads You to Pray-Pray!</h2></strong></p>


<p>I want to share with you an experience from my own life of a time when I was led by the Spirit to pray.</p>


<p>Back in 1979, we began holding Prayer and Healing School on the RHEMA campus. The musicians would sing a little bit, and we'd take up an offering. Then, they would turn the service over to me. Often, I would stay in a room by myself and pray before coming out to take over the service.</p>


<p>One day, I came walking into the little auditorium where we held Healing School. As the offering was being received, I sat down on the platform. Suddenly-that's the way the Holy Ghost moves-suddenly, you know, this burden came on me to pray! And I thought, "I have to pray, and I have to pray now. Somebody's life is in danger. Somebody's near death." I just sensed in my spirit that some-one, I didn't know who, but someone was near death.</p>


<p>I got up and said to the crowd, "Folks, I've got to pray and pray now. I have this burden. I have to pray, so let's pray now." I knelt down to pray, and I'll tell you, by the time my knees hit the floor, I was in the Spirit. I mean, I was praying in tongues. And I prayed earnestly for at least 45 minutes.</p>


<p>And then, I got a note of victory. I began to laugh. I began to sing quietly to myself. Praise God! I knew that whatever it was, and who-ever it was, I had the victory.</p>


<p>At 9:30 that night, I got a telephone call from a young lady whose mother had been a great supporter of this ministry for many years. Around 3 o'clock that afternoon, there had been an explosion in the Texaco Refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, and the young lady's father was caught in there with 17 other men. Six and a half hours had come and gone. The men were still trapped, and the firemen had not been able to put the fire out. They were in fear for the lives of all those men.</p>


<p>This young lady was calling to ask me to pray. I started laughing right on the phone because I suddenly realized who I had been pray-ing for earlier that day. I said, "There's no need to pray at this point. I already got the victory on that. I already got it! He's all right. Your father's all right."</p>


<p>My wife and I got off to bed, and at 1:30 in the morning, the phone rang. We had two phones, one by each of us, so we both answered.</p>


<p>It was the same young lady. She told us, "Momma just called. They finally got the fire put out, and they got in there, and they can't believe it. All 18 men are safe." Hallelujah!</p>


<p>Can you see why it's so important to pray when the Spirit leads you to pray? What if I hadn't prayed? I got the whole group at Heal-ing School to pray with me. What if we hadn't yielded to the Spirit? Those men could have died!</p>


<p>Learning to pray when the Holy Spirit leads us would avert many dangers. If Spirit-filled believers would follow His promptings and become prayer-conscious, many problems wouldn't happen.</p>
    
    <p>Many terrible things would never happen if folks were really led by the Spirit.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Great Things Happen When We Pray in the Spirit</h2></strong></p>


<p>Being led by the Spirit does more than avert trouble in our lives. It also helps us usher in wonderful moves of God. Great and mighty things have happened in the past as God's people have prayed. And great and mighty things are going to happen more and more. But they're not going to come just because God decides, "Well, I'm going to bless this one. I'm going to bless that one."</p>


<p>No! They will come as a result of our praying!</p>


<p>Back in 1942, I was the pastor of a church in East Texas. Toward the end of November of that year, I'd get up between 2 and 4 o'clock in the morning, Monday through Friday, and go into the living room to pray for an hour.</p>


<p>Now, I wasn't led to do that. Sometimes you're led. Sometimes you have a leading, a burden, to pray in certain ways and along certain lines. But I would simply pray in English to begin with. And I'd say:</p>


<p>"Lord, we thank You for all the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit: the three revelation gifts-the word of wisdom, the word of knowl-edge, and discerning of spirits, the three power gifts-faith, working of miracles, and gifts of healings; and the three vocal gifts-prophecy, divers kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues.</p>


<p>"Lord, we have an ample manifestation of the vocal gifts. We never have a service that doesn't have a tongue and interpretation. We have an ample manifestation of revelation gifts.</p>


<p>But it seems to me that there ought to be more manifestations of these power gifts: faith, the working of miracles, and gifts of healings. And so I pray that there will be a greater manifestation of these gifts than we've seen before."</p>


<p>Now, in about 15 minutes, I had said everything I knew to say in English. I'd be finished praying what my mind knew to pray. So I'd say, "I trust the Holy Ghost Who is living inside me to give me utter-ance to pray about this and anything else that God wants me to pray about." And I'd spend the rest of the hour praying in tongues.</p>


<p>I did that day after day, five days a week, week after week, from the last two weeks of November down to the 23rd day of February, 1943. That's over three months! And on the 23rd day of February, the Lord began to talk to me.</p>


<p>He said, "At the close of World War II, there will come a revival of divine healing to America." Well, that revival started in 1947, and it became the easiest thing in the world to get people healed. I learned later that other people were led by the Spirit to pray in that direc-tion. We had no communication with one another and didn't know we were all praying for the same thing. But thank God, He answered our prayers.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Persevering in Prayer</h2></strong></p>


<p>I believe that the same kind of breakthrough can happen today if we'll just stay in prayer until we have the victory.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 6:18</strong></p>

<p><strong>18-Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all persever-ance and supplication for all saints..</strong></p>


<p>What is perseverance? I heard one fellow call it "stickability." Just stay with it. Stay with praying until you've prayed through. I think that many times, if something doesn't happen fast enough, we give up too soon. And if we give up, we won't see the results God intends for us to have.</p>


<p>I'm reminded of a story I heard about the East Texas oil field. Much of the oil has been pumped out through the years. But back in the late 1930s, it was thriving. A man in the oil business there had made a million dollars and then lost it. A bank was financing him so he could drill another well. The money ran out, and he still hadn't hit oil. But he was convinced that if he could go just 50 feet deeper, he would hit oil.</p>


<p>One way or another, he talked the banker into extending a little bit more money. He drilled 50 feet farther down and hit a gusher. It made him a multimillionaire overnight.</p>


<p>Well, what if he'd quit? What if the bankers had said, "No, we've given you all we can give you. That's it! That's the end of it." But they drilled just a little farther and hit a gusher.</p>


<p>I think sometimes if we'd just pray with a little more perseverance, if we'd just be more determined, we'd have greater manifestations of the gifts of the Spirit. We'd see great and mighty things happen!</p>
