<p><strong>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Ephesians 5:18-21</strong></p>

<p>[This appendix has been edited from a transcript of Brother Hagin's evening mes-sage given on February 18, 2002, during Kenneth Hagin Ministries' Winter Bible Seminar. Ed.]</p>



<p>In writing to the church at Ephesus, Paul encouraged the believers to "be filled with the Spirit." We need to be filled with the Spirit if we're to be led by Him. But many Christians have been confused about what it means to be filled with the Spirit. This confusion comes from a misunderstanding of what the Scriptures tell us about the believers at Ephesus.</p>


<p>Acts chapter 19 tells us the believers in the church at Ephesus had already been filled with Spirit.</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 19:1-2,6</strong></p>

<p><strong>1-And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</strong></p>

<p><strong>2-He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6-And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, THE HOLY GHOST CAME ON THEM; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</strong></p>


<p>If the believers in Ephesus had already been filled with the Holy Ghost, why would Paul encourage them to be filled with the Spirit in the fifth chapter of Ephesians? The answer lies in the Greek word for filled. Greek scholars tell us the word translated filled in Ephe-sians chapter 5 means "a continuous action." So Paul was telling the believers at Ephesus, "... BE BEING FILLED with the Spirit."</p>


<p>You see, there is one initial infilling with the Holy Ghost. That's what we call the baptism in the Holy Ghost, and we see an example of that baptism in Acts chapter 19. But there are many refillings throughout our life. Being filled with the Spirit is not simply a one-time event with a beginning and an end. It is a continuous, lifelong experience.</p>

<p>Notice the first part of Ephesians 5:18 says, "be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess." Well, people who get drunk don't quit at a sip of wine, do they? No, they keep drinking. In the same way, to be filled with the Spirit, you have to keep on drinking. You have to keep drawing from the Holy Ghost.</p>


<p>How do you draw on the Holy Ghost? You draw on Him by doing what the Word says about being filled with the Spirit. You maintain the characteristics of a Spirit-filled life.</p>


<p><strong><h2>First Characteristic: A Song in Your Heart</h2></strong></p>



<p>One characteristic of the Spirit-filled life is that you'll have a song in your heart. Let's look again at a verse from Ephesians chapter 5.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 5:19</strong></p>


<p><strong>19-Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.</strong></p>


<p>If you are filled with the Spirit, it will be recognizable. People will know it. You'll know it, too, because if you are full of the Holy Ghost, you will have a song in your heart. What does it mean to have a song in your heart? It means you've got joy!</p>


<p>The Bible says, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and JOY in the Holy Ghost" (Rom. 14:17). If you are full of joy, it will show on your face. You may even dance, sing, or laugh. Sometimes when you're full of joy, you just can't keep from laughing, even when you're by yourself!</p>


<p>So you see, being filled with the Spirit means you'll have joy and a song in your heart. Now, I don't mean some song that you get out of 2 songbook. The songs we sing in church are fine.</p>


<p>We ought to sing them. But they didn't have any songbooks back in the Apostle Paul's day. They didn't have printing presses back then.</p>


<p>Paul is talking about "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs." He is describing something that the Holy Ghost gives you. These songs come from your heart, on the spur of the moment. They are given to us by the Spirit to help us.</p>


<p>I've noticed that in the hard places of my life, I find myself speaking in psalms and spiritual songs. In the most severe places, I've spoken nearly all night long in psalms. One night, I actually did speak in psalms all night long. I never slept a wink that night!</p>


<p>During the tough times, the Holy Spirit inspires me. He gives me psalms to help me. Do you remember that Jesus said to His disci-ples, "I'll not leave you comfortless"? (See John 14:18.) He asked the Father to send "another Comforter," the Holy Spirit. The Amplified Bible translates the word Comforter as "Counselor, Helper, Interces-sor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby" (John 14:16). The Holy Ghost is our Standby. He's standing by to help us in the hard places in life. And those psalms He gave me helped me. They were a comfort to me.</p>


<p>Now, read what Paul wrote to the church at Colosse.</p>


<p><strong>COLOSSIANS 3:16</strong></p>

<p><strong>16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</strong></p>


<p>In Ephesians 5:19, Paul wrote that you ought to be "speaking to yourselves...." In that verse, he's talking about something you do in your own private prayer life. But here in Colossians, Paul says we can be "teaching and admonishing one another," or, in other words, speaking to one another.</p>


<p>That means we can speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs at all times. We can do it when we're praying alone. We can speak these songs to another individual. Or we can do it in a public assembly.</p>


<p>But notice the criteria God expects us to meet before we speak!</p>


<p>The Word of Christ is to first of all dwell in you "richly in all wisdom." Sometimes the Word of Christ dwells in people, but not in wisdom. Paul admonishes you to make sure it dwells in you in wisdom.</p>


<p>Let me give you an example. A number of years ago, way back in 1939, I knew two young men. One of them was 16, and the other one was 17. They got born again and later on were filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>


<p>One day, these two teenage boys went out hunting rabbits. They had a 22-caliber rifle with them. As they headed back home, they walked down a railroad track until they ran into a young boy. Then they stopped, because they wanted to witness to him.</p>


<p>They said to him, "Are you ready to die?"</p>


<p>Well, when this young boy heard what they said and saw that they had a .22 rifle, he took off running!</p>

    </p>
<p>Later on, these teenage boys said to me, "We weren't going to kill him. We were going to talk to him about Jesus. We wanted to know if he was ready to go to Heaven."</p>


<p>These boys had the Word of God in them. But they weren't using wisdom, so their plan failed. That's why the Word of God needs to dwell in us richly in all wisdom.</p>


<p><strong><h2>The Purpose of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</h2></strong></p>


<p>Notice that Colossians chapter 3. verse 16, goes on to say, "... teaching and admonishing one another." How  do we teach and admonish others? The rest of the verse tells us we do it "in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."

<p>Paul means that those psalms would teach and encourage believers.</p>


<p>If the Christians in Colosse were facing a test or trial, those psalms they received from the Holy Ghost would teach them or encourage them in what they were going through.</p>


<p>This benefit isn't something that belonged just to them. This belongs to every believer! Paul was not writing to just one or two people in those two churches. He was writing to the whole church at Ephesus and Colosse. He was writing to the whole group. And if he was writing to them, then he was writing to us. This benefit belongs to every single one of us!</p>


<p>Now in the Old Testament, no one had the Holy Spirit except the prophet, the priest, and the king. Each of those individuals was anointed by the Holy Ghost to stand in his or her particular office. David was both a king and a prophet. And many of the psalms he wrote were given to him by the Holy Ghost to help him pass a test or trial successfully. In David's hard times, the Holy Ghost gave him a psalm to encourage and teach him.</p>




<p><strong><h2>Speaking Psalms by Faith </h2></strong></p>

<p>We must have faith to step over into the area of speaking psalms from the Holy Ghost. It takes faith to possess anything that belongs to us, and certainly this blessing belongs to us. Speaking in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs is a means of keeping filled with the Spirit and being blessed.</p>


<p></p>Psalms come by the Holy Ghost, just like the interpretation comes for an utterance in tongues. When somebody speaks with other tongues, if you're going to interpret, the Holy Ghost anoints you to interpret. But you don't get the whole message before you start interpreting. Usually you will just get the first word or two.</p>


<p>The rest of the interpretation comes as you speak out what you already know to say. But you have to start out by faith, trusting the Holy Ghost to give you the rest of the interpretation.</p>




<p>The same is true with psalms. Sometimes I just get a single word.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll get two. Sometimes maybe one line. Then I just start speaking that out by faith.</p>


<p>Here is a psalm that the Lord gave me entitled "Victory"</p>

<p><strong>VICTORY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Victory is not in places.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Victory is not in things.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Victory is in Him, the Eternal One.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For there came One out from the Father long ago</strong></p> 

<p><strong>A Champion into this world,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Given by the Father's love,</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Who met the enemy in awful combat.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>And He arose victorious over death, hell, and the grave.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And He put the enemy to flight.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So the victory is yours tonight!</strong></p>


<p>These psalms just come out of my spirit. Here is another psalm that the Lord gave me.</p>


<p><strong>WALKING</strong></p>


<p><strong>Walking in the light is walking in the Word.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For the entrance of His Words giveth light.</strong></p>


<p><strong>I'm not in the darkness, but I'm in the light.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Those in the world are in darkness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Darkness envelops them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Darkness directs them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the enemy of darkness obsesses them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But I'm in the Light.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the Light of God shines upon my pathway. Ha, ha, ha, ha.</strong></p>

 <p><strong>And I'm full of praise.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>And I'm full of joy!</strong></p>

<p><strong>For the Lord is my Light.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yea, He is my salvation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He has put the enemy to flight.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The battle is not yours.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The battle is not mine.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But the victory belongs to both of us.</strong></p>


<p>You can see how these psalms would encourage a person in hard times, can't you? Glory to God! That's why we speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Second Characteristic: Giving Thanks</h2></strong></p>


<p>There's another way for Christians to stay filled with the Holy Ghost: thanksgiving. Notice what Paul says in Ephesians chapter 5.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 5:20</strong></p>


<p><strong>20-GIVING THANKS always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>


<p>A second characteristic of the Spirit-filled life is that you give thanks. If you are keeping filled with the Spirit, you are full of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Remember the scripture in Hebrews that says, "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name" (Heb. 13:15). God wants to hear you give thanks.</p>


<p>In connection with this same thought, let's look at a verse from Philippians chapter 4.</p>


<p><strong>PHILIPPIANS 4:6</strong></p>


<p><strong>6-Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication WITH THANKSGIVING let your requests be made known unto God.</strong></p>


<p>The words "be careful for nothing" are a little bit confusing to us. We use careful in a different sense than the translators of the King James Version did. But the Amplified translation helps us. It says, "Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything." Isn't that marvelous? I believe I can do what the Word says I can do, and the Word says, "Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything."</p>


<p>Somebody may say, "Well, if I can't worry, what am I going to In every thing do?" The rest of that verse tells you what to do. " by prayer and supplication <em>WITH THANKSGIVING</em> let your requests be made known unto God."</p>


<p>I believe we're way behind with the thanksgiving part. We pray and pray and pray. We ask God for things, or we ask Him for help, and there is nothing wrong with that. But we should also take time to thank God for everything He has done and is doing in our lives. And we should praise Him for Who He is.</p>


<p><strong><h2>Weighed on a Scale</h2></strong></p>


<p>When I first received the baptism in the Holy Ghost way back in 1937, I read the following testimony: A missionary on the foreign field contracted smallpox. This happened before doctors had the smallpox vaccine. Many times the disease was fatal, and it was very contagious, so they isolated this woman to keep it from spreading.</p>


<p>The missionary testified that as she was praying, the Lord gave her a vision. In the vision, she saw an old-fashioned balance scale. One side of the scale was labeled "prayer," and the other side was labeled "praise." She noticed the side for prayer was stacked high, and because of the load, it sank down. On the side for "praise" was just a little stack. As a result, this side was way up in the air.</p>


<p>The Lord said to her, "When your praises equal your prayers, you will be healed." The missionary went on to say, "For two days and nights, I slept very little. I didn't do anything but praise God. I knew I had to do a lot of praising to get caught up."</p>


<p>For two solid days, she didn't do anything but praise and give thanks to God. At the end of those two days, she was completely healed! Every symptom disappeared. Do you see the value of praise and thanksgiving?</p>


<p><strong><h2>When Should I Offer Thanks?</h2></strong></p>


<p>That missionary praised and thanked God, even under dire circum-stances. Notice that Hebrews 13:15 doesn't say, "Let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God every once in a while-if we feel like it, if everything is going good, and when we have a pocket full of money." We are to offer a sacrifice of praise continually.</p>


<p>And Ephesians 5:20 doesn't say, "Giving thanks every now and then, if everything is going all right." It says, "Giving thanks ALWAYS for all things unto God." Now that doesn't mean you thank God for what Satan is doing. You don't thank God for troubles, sickness, or suffering. No, in the midst of what Satan is doing, you thank God for the privilege to believe Him.</p>

<p>You thank Him that His Word is true and that He is faithful. You thank God for another opportunity to exercise and develop your faith.</p>


<p>Remember, if you are filled with the Spirit, thanksgiving is going to come out of your mouth. You're going to speak words of thanks. You're not thinking thanks but giving thanks for all things. Thanksgiving is the fruit of your lips.</p>


<p>There are too many people in the church who are full of griping and complaining, instead of being full of thanksgiving. They've always got something to gripe about.</p>

<p>I've heard people say, "They don't let me sing in the choir."Well, they don't let me sing in the choir either. They may have heard both of us, and that's the reason they don't!</p>


<p>Don't be full of griping and complaining. Be thankful and give God praise with the fruit of your lips.</p>


<p><h2 style="text-align: center;" >Third Characteristic: Listen to One Another</h2></p>


<p>The third characteristic of the Spirit-filled life is submitting your-selves to one another in the fear of God.</p>


<p><strong>EPHESIANS 5:21</strong></p>


<p><strong>21-Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</strong></p>


<p><strong>22-Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</strong></p>



<p>Many people have taken Ephesians 5:22 out of context and made it say something that it doesn't say. Many believe this verse means the husband is supposed to be a dictator, so to speak, and rule over his wife. Well, in the previous verse Paul said, "Submitting yourselves one ." Does that mean we're supposed to dominate one and  another and rule over each other? No!</p>

<p>Actually, the Greek word translated "submitting" doesn't refer to what people often associate with that word. Paul is not telling people to be doormats to one another. Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament says that the word submitting in verse 21 means "to yield to another's admonition or advice." The Bible is telling us to listen to and respect one another.</p>

<p>In the next verse where it says, "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands," it doesn't mean for the husband to dominate his wife. Instead, that verse is speaking specifically to the wives and instructing them to listen to their hus-bands and respect their position in the home.</p>


<p>We need to understand that when Paul said this, he was talking about situations where both husband and wife are saved-where both are Christians. He's not talking about an unsaved husband and a saved wife. What in the world could an unsaved husband tell of lasting value to a saved wife? While she should honor him as far as his position as the head within the home, she is not to sin for him. If your husband is not saved, obey the Word and pray for him. The Bible does not tell a woman to submit to sin.</p>


<p>No, Ephesians 5:21 says: "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God." In other words, listen to one another. Get along with one another.</p>


<p>You know, if you're filled with the Spirit, you're easy to get along with. Those folks who are hard to get along with are not filled with the Spirit. Now, they may have gotten filled with the Spirit at one time. They may be able to go back to some experience they had years ago, but they are not continually staying filled with the Spirit.</p>

<p>When you're filled with the Holy Ghost, you're not hard to please. And if somebody says something that you don't like, you don't let it bother you.</p>


 <p>One time, I was sitting in a meeting listening to a minister speak, and he made a negative remark about the faith message. Well, my flesh wanted to respond to what he said, but the Bible teaches us to keep the flesh under. So I kept myself under control and said, "Lord, bless him. I'm sure if I talked to him, I'd find out he really didn't mean that the way it sounded."</p>


<p>I kept my ears open to listen to him. And in about 10 minutes, he gave me an answer to a question on a Bible subject that I'd been studying for about 25 years and couldn't find the answer to. Well, what if I had shut him off and quit listening to him because he made a remark about the faith message? I might still be searching for that answer.</p>


<p>God wants believers to be led by the Spirit and to show forth the characteristics of a Spirit-filled life. Remember, to live a Spirit-filled life, we need to listen to one another; speak to ourselves in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and give thanks. When we do these things, we'll stay filled with the Spirit. We'll walk in the blessings of God. And we'll find it easy to be led by the Spirit.</p>
