   <strong>CHAPTER 12</strong> 
   <br>
   <h1 style="text-align: center;">Effects Of The Spirit's Indwelling</h1>
<p><strong>And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Acts 23:1</strong></p>

<p>It is interesting to go through the Epistles Paul wrote to the Church I and se see what he said about his conscience. You will notice that he always obeyed it.</p>


<p>Is your conscience a safe guide?</p>


<p>Yes, if your spirit has become a new man in Christ, it is because your conscience is the voice of your spirit.</p>


<p><strong>2 CORINTHIANS 5:17</strong></p>

<p><strong>17-Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new crea-ture: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</strong></p>


<p>These things take place in man's spirit, in the inward man. He is first a new creature a brand-new man in Christ. Second, old things have passed away-the nature of the devil in his spirit is gone. Third, ALL things have become new in his spirit-not in his body or in his mind-now he has the nature of God in his spirit.</p>


<p>Therefore, if your spirit is a new man with the life and nature of God in it, it is a safe guide.</p>


<p>A person who has not been born again could not follow the voice of his spirit. His spirit is unregenerate. His conscience would permit him to do anything.</p>



<p>When you have the life and nature of God in you, your conscience will not permit you to do just anything. And if you are born again, you have the life of God.</p>


<p><strong>JOHN 3:16</strong></p>

<p><strong>16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have EVERLASTING LIFE.</strong></p>


<p><strong>ROMANS 6:23</strong></p>

<p><strong>23-For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is ETERNAL LIFE through Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Someone said, "That just means we are going to live forever up in Heaven."</p>
    
    <p>No it dose not only mean that. Consider this scripture:</p>


<p><strong>1 JOHN 5:13</strong></p>

<p><strong>13-These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that YE HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.</strong></p>


<p>Have is present tense. We have eternal life now. If you are a born-again Christian, you have the life of God in your spirit now. You have the nature of God in your spirit now.</p>


<p>Oh! If people would learn to follow their spirits! If they would learn to take advantage of the life that is in them!</p>


<p>I joined the church and was baptized early in life but that didn't make me a Christian. My spirit was still unregenerate when I became totally bedfast with a heart condition at the age of 15. I was truly born again during the 16 months I was bedfast. Then in August 1934, as a Baptist boy reading Grandma's Methodist Bible, I was healed.</p>


<p>I went back to high school. I had missed one school year. Before I was born again, I just barely got by in some classes. Back then, if you made a "D" it was failing. And if you failed one subject you stayed in that grade and took the whole thing over again. </p>
    
    <p>Two teachers in two subjects said to me, "We gave you two points or you would have had a 'D'"</p>


<p>But after I was born again, I never made anything but a straight "A" report card. And I never took one book home to study.</p>


<p>Now I didn't know a thing about the baptism of the Holy Spirit then, but do you know what I did know? I knew I had the life of God in me!</p>


<p>As I walked down the street to school every morning. I had conversation with the Lord. Unconsciously, I was being led by the Spirit; my heart told me to do it, and I listened to my heart instead of my head.</p>


<p>I said, "Now, Lord, I read in the Old Testament where Daniel and the three Hebrew children were in school in Babylon and You gave them favor with the dean of the school (Dan. 1:9). God, give me favor with every teacher. Thank You for it; I have it now. I also read, that when their three years of training were over, the three Hebrew children were 10 times smarter than the rest (vv. 18-20). Lord, I have Your life in me. John 1:4 says, 'In him was life; and the life was the light of yen.' Light stands for development. Impart to me knowledge and skill n all learning and wisdom that I may be ten times better..</p>


<p>Every day as I walked to school I would confess, "In Him was life and the life was the light of men. That life is in me. The life of God is in me. That life is the light-it is the development of me. It is developing my spirit. It is developing my mentality. I have God in me. I have God's wisdom in me. I have God's life in me. That life of God in my spirit dominates me. I purpose in my heart to walk in the light of life."</p>



<p>Now I do not mean that I just skipped by. In study hall periods at school I studied. I listened intently in class to everything that was said. But by receiving eternal life into my spirit, and getting my mind renewed with the Word, my mentality was increased from 30 to 60 percent.</p>



<p>The life of God will do that for anyone.</p>


<p>The most amazing miracle I have ever seen of eternal life affecting someone's mentality occurred in a girl I'll call Mary. Her mentality was increased by at least 90 percent.</p>


<p>Mary started to school at seven and went seven years without getting out of the first grade. In those seven years she never learned to write her name. Finally, they asked her parents to take her out of school.</p>


<p>In the church I pastored, Mary was at that time 18 years old.although she behaved like a two-year-old. She would get down and crawl around on the floor like a baby. If she happened not to be sit-ting with her mother, she would slide under the pews, or lift up her skirt and step over them to get to where her mother was. Her clothes were always a sight. Her hair was never combed.</p>


<p>Then one night during an evangelistic revival meeting, Mary came to the altar. There she received eternal life the nature of God.</p>


<p>A drastic change occurred instantly. The very next night she sat in the service and behaved like any other 18-year-old young lady. She had fixed her hair and dressed up. Her mentality seemed to have increased overnight.</p>


<p>Years later I was back in the city to help with a funeral. "What ever happened to Mary?" I asked the church secretary. She led me out on the front porch.</p>


<p>"See all those new houses going up out there."</p>


<p>I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"That's an addition to the city. Mary is building that. She's a widow now. She handles all her own money. She is her own financier. She has three lovely children. They are on the front pew every Sunday. They are the best dressed, and the most well-mannered children in church. As church secretary I can tell you that Mary's tithes and offerings are here every Sunday."</p>


<p>The life of God came into her!</p>


<p>I am convinced we have never completely learned what we have received. Most of us have thought that the Lord just forgave us, saying that we're the same old creature we always were. We'll just try to hold out faithful till the end. If we get enough people to pray for us, maybe we can make it.</p>


<p>No, thank God, the life of God has been imparted into our spirits! The nature of God is in our spirits. The Holy Spirit is living and abiding in our spirits.</p>
