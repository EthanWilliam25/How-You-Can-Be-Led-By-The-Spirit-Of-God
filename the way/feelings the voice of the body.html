   <h1 style="text-align: center;" >Fellings The Voice Of The Body</h1>

<p><strong>The Spirit itself [Himself] beareth witness with our spirit..</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Romans 8:16</strong></p>

<p>Too often people think that the witness this verse is talking about T is a physical something. It is not. It is a spiritual something. It is the Spirit of God bearing witness with our spirits. He does not bear witness with our bodies. You cannot go by physical feeling.</p>


<p>We confuse things by the way we talk. We say, "I feel God's Pres-ence." No, we don't. We sense His Presence spiritually. Use the word feeling advisedly; it leaves the wrong impression that it is a physical feeling. Don't mix the physical with it.</p>


<p>Feeling is the voice of the body.</p>


<p>Reason is the voice of the soul, or the mind.</p>

<p>Conscience is the voice of the spirit.</p>

<p>To go by feeling is to get into trouble. That is the reason so many Christians are up and down (I call them yo-yo Christians), and in and out. They go by their feelings. They don't walk by faith. They don't walk by their spirits.</p>


<p>When they feel good, they say, "Glory to God, I'm saved. Hallelujah, I'm filled with the Spirit. Everything is fine." When they feel bad, their faces are long and they say, "I've lost it all. I don't feel like I did, so I must be backslidden."</p>


<p>I hear people, bless their hearts, talking about being in the valley, then being on the mountaintop, then getting back down in the valley again. I have never been in the valley. I have been saved more than fifty years and I have never been anywhere but on the mountaintop. You do not have to get down in the valley.</p>


<p>People talk about "valley experiences." I have never had any valley experiences. Oh, yes, there have been tests and trials, but I was on the mountaintop all the time, shouting my way through-living above the tests and the trials!</p>


<p>A woman we had pastored in years gone by came to a meeting where we were and told us about her 39-year-old daughter. They were about to operate on her when they discovered she had a tumor. Then they also found through hospital tests that she was a diabetic. They were trying to get the diabetic condition under control when she went into a coma. Three doctors said she would never regain consciousness; she would die.</p>


<p>This mother said, "Will you lay your hands on this handkerchief?"I did, and we prayed. Then that mother got on a bus and rode 300 miles back to the hospital where her daughter lay unconscious. She reached under the oxygen tent and laid the handkerchief on her daughter's chest. The minute it touched her, she revived. She was healed, born again, filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, all in one application.</p>

<p>The nurses got excited and called the doctor. The doctor said, "This is wonderful that she has regained consciousness. But she must remain quiet." He gave her a shot to quiet her down-but it never did take effect. She just kept on speaking in tongues and shouting, "I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed."</p>


<p>The next day they began to run tests. Her blood was perfect. She no longer had diabetes. Then they couldn't find the tumor. It had disappeared. After several days they dismissed her.</p>


<p>This woman told my wife and me sometime later that the doc-tor said, "We won't charge you anything. We didn't do anything. A Higher Power than us did it."</p>


<p>Now, three years later, when she was 42 years old, her sister brought her to our door at 2 o'clock one morning. She had another tumor.</p>


<p>I thought she had come to be healed. So I said, "You can be healed again. We will just lay hands on you."</p>


<p>She said, with tears, "Brother Hagin, I don't really care whether I get healed or not. Really, if I could just get back to where I was with God I would just as soon die and go on to Heaven."</p>


<p>When she said this, I assumed she must have backslidden. She looked so sad, I just knew she must have committed some terrible sin. So I said, "The Lord will forgive you ..." And I went through what the Bible says about that. Then I said, "We'll all just kneel down here by the couch. (My wife and the woman's sister were there too.) I will kneel beside you. Now you don't have to confess to me, but tell the Lord about it and He will forgive you."</p>


<p>She looked up at me and said, "Brother Hagin, I've searched my heart, and as far as I know, I haven't done anything wrong."</p>


<p>I got aggravated. I'd gotten to bed late-I was driving a distance and holding meetings every night. And just right in the middle of good sound sleep, early in the morning, came this knocking at the door that woke us.I guess I did speak sharply to her; I know I did.</p>


<p>I said, "Get up from the floor. Sit down there on that couch." I was disgusted. "If you haven't done anything wrong, what in the world makes you think you have to get back to God?"</p>


<p>"Well," she said, "I don't feel like I used to."</p>


<p>I said, "What has that got to do with it? If I were going by feeling, half the time when I get up to preach I would announce that I must be backslidden."</p>


<p>She looked at me. "Do you mean preachers are that way too?"</p>


<p>I said, "Yes, we're just as human as anyone else. In fact, if I were going by feelings right now, I would be having you pray for me. I don't feel a thing. I haven't felt a thing since you got here."</p>


<p>She said, "What do you do then? How do you pray through?"</p>


<p>I said, "I don't pray through. I'm already through. A Christian ought to walk through he ought to be through living in fellowship with God, every day, every minute, every hour."</p>


<p>She said, "What do you do then?"</p>


<p>"Well," I said, "just sit there and watch me. I'm going to close my eyes and pray, but you keep your eyes open."</p>


<p>Then I prayed, "Dear Lord, I'm so glad that I'm a child of God. I'm so glad I'm saved. I'm so glad I have been born again. I don't feel any-thing but that has nothing to do with it. My inward man is a new man. My inward man is a new creature in Christ. I want to thank You that not only am I born again but I'm filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit reside in me. I want to thank You for that. Hallelujah!"</p>


<p>I didn't feel anything, but I said it anyhow. Then, when I confessed that, in my spirit (He was in there all the time) something began to bubble up inside of me. It was a move and manifestation of the Spirit of God. I still did not feel anything, but in my spirit I could sense that bubbling. It got up in my throat. I began to laugh-there is a laugh in the Spirit. I began to speak in tongues.</p>


<p>This lady said, "The expression on your face changed. Your face just lit up."</p>


<p>I said, "That was in there all the time. Paul told Timothy to stir up the gift that was in him. I just stirred up what I had in me all the time."</p>


<p>She said, "Can I do that?"</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, you can."</p>

<p>She did she stirred up what was in her all the time.</p>

<p>I do not remember even praying about the tumor. The last account I had of her, it had disappeared.</p>


<p>Base your faith on the Word-not on your feelings. Romans 8:16 does not say that the Spirit beareth witness with our bodies, or with our feelings.</p>


<p>Smith Wigglesworth, the great English apostle of faith, said, "I am not moved by what I feel. I am not moved by what I see. I am moved only by what I believe. I cannot understand God by feelings. I under-stand God by what the Word says about Him. I understand the Lord Jesus Christ by what the Word says about Him. He is everything the Word says He is."</p>


<p>You cannot understand yourself by feelings. Understand yourself as a born-again, Spirit-filled Christian by what the Word of God says about you. And when you read what the Word says about youâ€”then, whether you feel like it or not, say, "Yes, that's me. I have that. The Word says I have that. I can do what the Word says I can do. I am what the Word says I am."</p>


<p>You will begin to develop spiritually then.</p>


<p>And it is with your spirit that the Holy Spirit bears witness.</p>
