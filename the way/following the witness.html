    <strong>CHAPTER 10</strong>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Following The Witness</h1>

<p><strong>For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Psalm 18:28</strong></p>


<p>We left that church. We were asked by leaders of a denomination to take another church to fill in temporarily, so we did.</p>


<p>Later, while I would be in my study praying, I would get a bur-den to go back to the church I'd left as a result of the fleece. I hadn't finished what God wanted me to do there.</p>


<p>Usually this happened when I was praying about my sermon and the Sunday services in other tongues-because remember, when I pray in tongues, my spirit prays, and the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord. I would get such a burden for the church I had left more than two years before, I would jump up and run out of the room to get away from it.</p>


<p>Once I came to myself out in the street beside the church wondering, How did I get out here? To get out there I would have had to run out of the church study, across the auditcium, and out the side door. But I didn't remember doing that. I was under such a burden for that church, and I was trying to get away from it. I didn't want to go back there to pastor.</p>


<p>Finally, after about 30 days of that, I said, "Lord, are You talking to me about going back there? Are You trying to give me some guid. ance?" Then I said, "Talk to my wife. She can listen too."</p>


<p>One morning while we washed dishes, I said to my wife, "Honey, if the Lord says anything to you, let me know." I didn't tell her any-thing more.</p>


<p>Then I waited 30 days. You don't have to get in a big hurry about some things. The Bible says, "... he that believeth shall not make haste" (Isa. 28:16). Faith doesn't get in a hurry. The devil will try to push you. He will say, "Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry." He will try to move you out of faith, move you into doubt, move you into unbelief, and get you away from the leading of God.</p>


<p>Thirty days later, as I washed the dishes and my wife dried them, I said, "Has the Lord been talking to you?"</p>


<p>"If He has, I don't know it."</p>


<p>I got a little more pointed in order to bring her out. I said, "Has the ?" I called Lord said anything to you about going back to the name of the city where the church was.</p>


<p>"Oh," she said, "I thought that was just me."</p>


<p>"Well," I said, "let's analyze what you mean when you say me."</p>


<p>If you mean the flesh, then that wouldn't be right. But if you mean the real "me," the man on the inside the real you then that is right. Remember that the spirit is the candle of the Lord. Then it is not just you, the outward man, it is the Lord lighting the candle for you-the inward man-the man on the inside</p>


<p>"I want to ask you a question," I said to her, "so we can ascertain just which this is. From the physical, from the mental, just naturally speaking, do you want to go back there?"</p>


<p>"Oh, no!"</p>


<p>"It couldn't be you then, could it? (It would have been better to say, it couldn't have been the flesh, the natural man, the outward man.) You're not going to be thinking about doing something you don't want to do."</p>


<p>I saw she had the inward witness just as I did. Sometimes the inward witness is there and people don't recognize it.</p>


<p>"I am convinced," I told her, "that God is leading us that way. It will have to be God to open it up and get us back there. Let's just let Him do it."</p>


<p>He did. Within a few months, without my doing anything to work it out, I was invited to preach a week in that church. Afterwards, the board asked if I would be interested in coming back to pastor.</p>

<p>I didn't tell them I had something from God. I just said, "I might be."</p>

<p>They said, "We have all been talking and the church wants you back."</p>


<p>"Well," I said, "they would have to vote on me. So I'll tell you what I'll do just go ahead and vote, and I will tell you afterwards."</p>


<p>From the natural standpoint my wife and I still did not want to go back there. Although we loved the people, we did not want to live in that town. We did not want to live in that house. In my heart I wanted to obey God, but everything about my flesh recoiled. In my natural man, my outward man, and in my own natural human thinking and mind, I did not want to go back there.</p>


<p>So really, as I kept praying and fasting while the church board was making all the proper announcements and advertising the election, I was actually saying to the Lord that I didn't want to trust that inward witness I knew both my wife and I had.</p>


<p>I was over into the third day of a fast. I wanted the Lord to move in some spectacular way-I wanted some kind of a word, tongues and interpretation, a prophecy, or God just to write up in the sky, "GO TO THAT PLACE." I was on my knees bawling and squawling and begging because I didn't know any better.</p>


<p>God also leads by an inward voice as well as by an inward witness. That inward voice said, "Get up from there and quit acting like that."</p>


<p>I got up. Then I said, "Lord, if You could just give me some supernatural sign, I would feel better about this." He said, "You have all I am going to give you. You don't need any supernatural sign. You don't need any supernatural writing in the sky. You don't need any tongues and interpretation. You don't need any prophecy. You know on the inside of you what to do. Now do it."</p>


<p>I said, "Okay, I will."</p>

<p>Many times we ignore the inward witness. We want something out in the sense realm. We seek the sensational and miss the supernatural.</p>


<p><strong>Let's learn that God leads all of His children, primarily, by the inward witness.</strong></p>
