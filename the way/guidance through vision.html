   <strong>CHAPTER 26</strong> 
   <br>
   <h1 style="text-align: center;" >Guidance Through Vision</h1>


<p><strong>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,

A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Acts 10:1-3</strong></p>

<em>Sometimes God leads through visions.</em>

<p>Cornelius was a devout man, but he was not born again. He did not know about Jesus. He was a Jewish proselyte. The angel who appeared to him in this vision could not preach the gospel to him.</p>

<p>God did not call angels to preach the gospel; God called men to preach the Gospel. However, the angel did tell Cornelius where to send for someone who could preach the Gospel to him and tell him how to be saved.</p>


<p>Cornelius saw an angel in a vision. Angels also have the ability, as God permits, to take upon themselves a visible form which can be seen with the natural eye, just as you can see a physical person.</p>


<p><strong>HEBREWS 13:2</strong></p>


<p><strong>2-Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</strong></p>


<p>The scripture calls Cornelius' experience a vision (Acts 10:3). It was a spiritual vision. Cornelius saw into the spirit world, and there are angels out there in the spirit world. If others had been present, they would not have seen anything. Yet if the angel had taken on a visible form, anyone could have seen it.</p>


<p><strong>There are three kinds of visions: spiritual visions, trances, and open visions.</strong></p>

<p>In a spiritual vision, you see with the eyes of your spirit-not with your physical eye. When Paul saw the Lord in Acts chapter 9, it was a spiritual vision. He did not see Him with his physical eyes.</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 9:8</strong></p>


<p><strong>8-And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</strong></p>


<p>When the Lord spoke to Saul, his eyes were shut. Therefore, what-ever it was that Paul saw, he did not see it with his physical eyes.</p>


<p>We  know this because the Bible says that when his eyes WERE OPENED, he was blind.</p>


<p>The second type of vision is when one falls into a trance. Corne-lius did not fall into a trance-but Peter did.</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 10:9-11</strong></p>


<p><strong>9-On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray about the sixth hour:</strong></p>

<p><strong>10-And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</strong></p>

<p><strong>11-And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descend-ing unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth.</strong></p>


<p>When one falls into a trance, his physical senses are suspended. He does not know where he is right at the moment. He is not uncon-scious, but he does not know what is going on around him. He is more conscious of spiritual things than physical things.</p>


<p>The third type of vision is what I call an open vision. The vision that occurred in El Paso in 1959 (which I have referred to in this book), was an open vision. My eyes were wide open. My physical serises were intact. I did not fall into a trance. Jesus walked into my room. I saw Him with my physical eyes.</p>


<p>Of all the visions I have had, only two were open visions.</p>


<p>Three of them occurred when I fell into a trance. The rest were spiritual visions.</p>


<p>There were different types of visions in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>


<p>There are different types of visions now.</p>


 <p>For example, in visions, sometimes things are symbolic. In Peter'i vision they were. He saw all manner of creeping things, both clean and unclean. He had to think on the vision in order to understand it (Acts 10:19). The Spirit spoke to him as he thought upon the vision and bade him go with three men to Cornelius' house. Peter still didn't know exactly what the vision meant. But when he went, things hap pened, and he began to understand that God had called the Gentiles into redemption as well as The Jews.</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 8:26-29</strong></p>


<p><strong>26-And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</strong></p>

<p><strong>27-And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</strong></p>

<p><strong>28-Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>29-Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</strong></p>


<p>Some church people admit that God spoke to the apostles such as Peter, but they say that such divine visitations were only for the apostles. But Philip was not an apostle. He was elected as a deacon first (Acts 6:5). The highest office he ever filled was that of the evan-gelist (Acts 21:8). Isn't it sad that in the church world we have been robbed of the blessings and the supernatural manifestations we should have had because people closed the book on the supernatural and said, "That was just for the apostles. All that ceased when the apostles of the New Testament died."</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 9:10-12</strong></p>


<p><strong>10-And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11-And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</strong></p>

<p><strong>12-And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</strong></p>

<p>Ananias was not a deacon. He was just a disciple. He was what we would call a layman. Yet the Lord used him. We should all put ourselves in a position where God can use us as He sees fit. We don't have to wait for a vision before we do something for God. God may give us a vision, or He may not. An angel may appear to us, or one may not.</p>


<p>It was a great privilege for me to speak in the church of a certain great man of God when he was past seventy years of age. He had been filled with the Spirit way back at the turn of the century and had gone out to China as a missionary in 1912. He told me of many marvelous experiences he'd had.</p>


<p>He had a Bible study every Friday night in his church. (I believe he was one of the world's foremost Bible teachers and I have heard most of them.) He related this to me: He said he would teach certain subjects as the Lord directed, but he also let the congregation suggest subjects by writing them down on a slip of paper. On one occasion, the majority of the congregation wrote, "We would like some teach-ing on angels. We have never heard any teaching on that subject."</p>


<p>He had spent a number of years teaching in one of the best Pentecostal Bible schools, and he thought he could cover the subject in two weeks. But he said, "The more I studied, the bigger it got. I taught six week  and still did not cover the subject."</p>


<p>This man was an official of his Full Gospel denomination. Soon after this teaching on angels he was in a business meeting with leaders of that denomination. One matter of discussion concerned the report that a minister of their denomination claimed to have seen an angel. He said that the angel instructed him concerning his ministry. They were about to bar him from the denomination.</p>


<p>This Bible teacher said, "I just sat there and listened. I didn't even comment. I never did talk unless I was called on to talk. I could see the trend; they were about ready to turn this other minister out of the denomination."</p>


<p>Finally, one brother got up and said, "I believe we ought to hear from Brother S. He has been with us from the beginning of the movement. He is one of our most able Bible teachers. Let's hear what he has to say."</p>


<p>He told me he began by telling them about the study of angels he had just completed and taught in his church. Then he said, "I am not the least bit concerned because one out of several thousand of our ministers has seen an angel. The thing that disturbs me is why more of us are not seeing them.</p>


<p>"Then secondly," he told them, "if we are going to turn this man out for seeing an angel who instructed him concerning his ministry, what are we going to give our people in the place of it? Do we have anything better? anything more supernatural? anything more scrip-tural? If we do not, I think we had better stay with what we have."</p>



<p>Quickly, someone jumped to his feet and said, "I move that we table this and forget all about it." They voted unanimously to leave it alone.</p>

<p>In 1963, my office occupied only the den of my little frame home in Garland, Texas. It wasn't really much of an office at that. Some men in another city contacted me. They said, "If you will move your office to this city, we will set up an office for you. We will buy all the office equipment, hire the secretaries, and pay their salaries. You won't have to pay anything. Let's get some of your material published."</p>



<p>Another man, who was an electronic technician, said, "Brother Hagin, if you will let me, I will make tapes of all your sermons. It won't cost you a thing. I will furnish all the materials free of charge."</p>


<p>Those offers sounded good. You would think God must be in them. But about that time I was praying with a certain group. We were having special times of ministering to the Lord. It was the kind of atmosphere Acts 13:1 and 2 speaks of an atmosphere where God will move.</p>



<p>I was sitting on the platform beside a chair, praying, when suddenly Jesus stood right in front of me. I had my eyes shut. It was a spiritual vision. I did not fall into a trance. Standing right behind Jesus, about rwo feet to His right and three feet behind Him, was a large angel. I had seen angels before but never one that big. He must have been 8 feet tall or more.</p>


<p>Jesus talked to me about some things. (And everything He said came to pass.) Occasionally, while He talked, I would glance at that angel. When I did, the angel would open his mouth and start to say something. When I looked back to Jesus, he would not say anything.</p>


<p>After Jesus finished His conversation with me, I asked, "Who is that fellow? What does he represent?"</p>


<p>Jesus said, "That's your angel."</p>

<p>I said, "My angel?"</p>


<p>"Yes," He said, "your angel. You read in the Scriptures that I said concerning the little children that their angel is ever before My Father's face. You don't lose your angel just because you grow up."</p>


<p>(Isn't that comforting! I have that big fellow following me around. Praise the Lord!)</p>


<p>I said, "What does he want?"</p>


<p>Jesus said, "He has a message for you."</p>


<p>Then I got so letter-of-the-Word conscious I could have missed the Spirit. I said, "You are talking to me; why don't You give me the message? Why do I have to listen to an angel? Besides that, the Word of God says as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. I have the Holy Ghost. Why couldn't the Holy Ghost talk to me?"</p>


<p>Jesus had mercy on me, and patience with me. He said, "Did you ever read in My Word where the angel of the Lord told Philip to go down to the way of Gaza? Wasn't that direction? Wasn't that guid-ance? Didn't my angel appear to Cornelius, and he wasn't even a born-again man? Didn't the angel tell him what to do?"</p>


<p>He gave me several more New Testament examples. Finally, I said, "That's enough. I will listen."Then I looked up to this big fellow and said, "What is it?"</p>


<p>He started this way, "I am sent from the Presence of Almighty God to tell you not to let these men (and he called their names) set up an office for you. They have an ulterior motive. They will control your ministry because they will have put in all the money."</p>


<p>Then he called the name of the man who was the radio and elec-tronic technician and said, "Don't let him have any of your tapes. He has an ulterior motive. If he gets them into his hands, he will control them. I am sent from the Presence of Almighty God to tell you that.</p>


<p>"Then I am sent from the Presence of Almighty God to tell you this: The money will come so that you can set up your own office, have your own books, have your own tapes. You will be the head of it, the sole boss, because I am going to tell you what to do, and not some man.</p>

<p>Within four months, after everything is paid and cleared out, you will have enough money to get you headed this direction. For I have sent my angels out to cause the money to come."</p>


<p>When that time came, I had $4,000 which was enough to do what the Lord had told me to do. That was the beginning of this ministry.</p>


<p>I could tell more, but this is enough to illustrate that these things do happen. But let me emphasize this although God does lead us through visions and other supernatural manifestations, I would encourage you NOT to seek a vision. You could get beyond the Word where the devil can deceive you. We often prefer to have a more direct word of guidance, but we don't always have it. So don't try to manufacture it, if it is not there. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that anyone was seeking a vision when one came. Visions just happened without anyone in the Bible seeking them.</p>


<p>Be content, if it is all you ever have, to follow the inward witness. But educate and train and develop your human spirit so that inward witness becomes more and more real to you.</p>


<p>Then, if God sees fit for supernatural visitations and manifestations, just thank God for them.</p>


<p><strong>Know that the angels of God are with you. Your angel is with you whether you ever see him or not.</strong></p>
