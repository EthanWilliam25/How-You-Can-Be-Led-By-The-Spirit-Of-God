    <strong>CHAPTER 18</strong>
    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >Help From Within</h1>

<p><strong>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-John 16:13</strong></p>

<p>Let's notice some things Jesus said about the Holy Spirit in John L 16:13. <em>"....he will guide you into all truth...."</em> He will lead you. He will guide you.</p>


<p>"... for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak...." The Holy Spirit does speak. Whatever He hears God say, whatever He hears Jesus say, He will speak to your spirit. Where is He to speak? He is in your spirit, and that is where He speaks. He doesn't speak out in the air somewhere. He speaks on the inside. The Holy Spirit passes God's message on to your spirit, either by an inward witness, by the still small voice the voice of your con science, or by an inward voice which is the more authoritative voice of the Holy Spirit.</p>


<p>"... he will shew you things to come. .." I do not believe this just means that the Holy Spirit will show us about future events as recorded in the Word of God. It also means that the Holy Spirit will show you things to come. In my own individual life, for instance, there has never been a death in our close family that I did not know about in advance. I knew two years ahead of time that my father-in-law was going to die, so I began to prepare my wife for his death. She was his only daughter, the baby of the family, and very close to her father. I knew she would take it hard. So I began to say to her, "Honey, you know Mr. Rooker is getting older. Then over the next two years I dropped a word here and there, just getting her ready.</p>


<p>I was away in a meeting when the telephone call came. After the service one night, I was sitting in the hotel. The phone rang. Something in me said, "That's for you. This is what you have been talking about for two years now." Within twenty-eight days he was in Heaven. You are not unprepared when you know things ahead of time.</p>


<p><strong>JOHN 14:26</strong></p>

<p><strong>26-But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</strong></p>


<p>The Holy Spirit shall teach you.</p>

<p>He shall bring all things to your remembrance.</p>

<p>People often ask me how I remember things. At one time I could quote three-fourths of the New Testament.</p>

<p>"How do you memorize scripture?"</p>

<p>I always answer, "I never memorized scripture in my life. I know nothing about memorization. I suppose you could develop your mind if you worked at it. But I just get to talking and it rises up in me. The Holy Spirit brings it to my remembrance. He is inside of me."</p>


<p>The Holy Spirit will show you things to come and bring things to your remembrance if you will learn to cooperate with Him.</p>
