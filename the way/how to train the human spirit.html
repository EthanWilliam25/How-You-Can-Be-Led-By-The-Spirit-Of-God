    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >How To Train The Human Spirit</h1>

<p><strong>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Proverbs 20:27</strong></p>


<p>The Lord enlightens us and guides us through our spirits. If that be the case and it is then we need to become more spirit-conscious. We need to become more conscious of the fact that we are spirit beings, and not just mental or physical beings. We need to train our spirits so they will become safer and safer guides.</p>


<p>One thing which has held back the Christian world as a whole is that we are more physical-conscious (body-conscious) and more mental-conscious (soul-conscious) than we are spirit-conscious. We have developed the body and the soul, but we have left the spirit of man almost untouched.</p>


<p>I have a cassette teaching tape which has helped many Christians in this area. In one of our meetings, one young man I know quite well gave his testimony of how it had helped him:</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, when he was 31 or 32, he went into business. He left his salaried job with a total of $5,500. He was single at that time and he had to use this money for living expenses as well as for capital. At one point, his nest egg dwindled to $50.</p>



<p>He gave this testimony: "I listened to Brother Hagin's tapes. There were three on faith and confession, and one called "How to Train the Human Spirit." I went to bed every night listening to that tape. I put it on in the morning and listened to it while I shaved. I listened to it over and over and over again-probably hundreds of times-until that message got into my spirit. Then by listening to my spirit and using my faith, my assets now total in excess of $30 million."</p>


<p>This young man is only about 38 years old now. He is not a preacher. He is a businessman. He has told me how his spirit has spoken to him and told him how to invest and buy land.</p>


<p>I will give the essence of the teaching contained on that cassette in this chapter: How to Train the Human Spirit.</p>


<p>Your spirit can be educated just as your mind can be educated. Your spirit can be built up in strength and trained just as your body can be built and trained. Here are four rules by which you can train and develop your own human spirit.</p>


<p><strong>1. By meditation in the Word</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. By practicing the Word</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. By giving the Word first place</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. By instantly obeying the voice of your spirit</strong></p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;" >BY MEDITATION IN THE WORD OF GOD</h2>

<p>The most deeply spiritual men and women I know are those who give time to meditation in the Word of God. You cannot develop spiritual wisdom without meditation. God made that fact known to Joshua just after the death of Moses at the very beginning of Joshua's ministry.</p>

<p><strong>JOSHUA 1:8</strong></p>

<p><strong>8-This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</strong></p>


<p>If God did not want Joshua to be prosperous, why did He tell him how to prosper? If He did not want him to succeed, why did He tell him how to have good success? He wanted Joshua to be success-ful-and He wants you to be successful.</p>


<p>Paraphrasing this truth in New Testament language, we would say, "The Word of God-particularly the New Testament-shall not depart out of your mouth. But meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you will make your way prosperous and you will have good success."</p>


<p>If you ever want to do anything great in life, if you ever want to amount to anything in life, take time to meditate in the Word of God. Start out with at least 10 or 15 minutes a day-then increase the time.</p>


<p>I left the last church I pastored in 1949 and I have been out in the field ministry ever since. I used to do much more fasting and a differ-ent kind of praying than I do now. (You learn things as you go along.)</p>


<p>Running two services a day which I always did and sometimes three, takes a lot out of you physically as well as spiritually. I would teach every morning, pray out loud all afternoon, and preach every night. I ate only one meal a day during my meetings and by exerting so much physical energy, I would grow weak. Then two days a week were my fast days-Tuesday and Thursday. I ate no food and drank no water for 24 hours.</p>


<p>One day the Lord said to me, "I would rather you would live a fasted life instead of having days and periods of fasting."</p>


<p>I said, "What do you mean? I never heard anyone say that!"</p>


<p>The Lord said, "Instead of having certain days you fast and then going back and eating all you want, just live a fasted life. Fasting does not change Me anyhow. I am the same before you fast, while you fast, and when you get through fasting. It does not change My Word. It helps you keep your flesh under. So just don't ever eat all you want. Just keep your flesh under all the time."</p>



<p>Then He said, "Don't spend all that time in the afternoon praying and wearing yourself out before the night service. Lie on the bed and meditate."</p>


<p>So I began to lie there in the afternoons, meditating. And I got further meditating than I ever did praying and fasting. I grew more spiritually.</p>


<p>That is what God is saying in Joshua 1:8: <em>"... for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous..."</em> I wanted to be prosperous in the ministry. "and then thou shalt have good success." I wanted to have good success in the ministry. This works whether you are in the ministry, whether you raise cattle, sell automobiles, or whatever you do.</p>


<p>This Word of God shall not depart out of thy mouth. Talk about the Word. But thou shalt meditate therein. Think on the Word.</p>


<p>The Hebrew word translated meditate, also carries this thought with it: To mutter. Mutter the Word. Speak it to yourself.</p>


<p>The Lord led me, before I ever heard anyone teach on medita-tion, to lie on the bed and mutter the Word. I just said it to myself. And I would have some of the most tremendous services. I developed myself spiritually, and at the same time conserved my physical strength.</p>


<p>I like another translation of Joshua 1:8. The last phrase reads like this: "you shall be able to deal wisely in the affairs of life." You could not have good success if you did not know how to deal wisely in the affairs of life.</p>


<p>How can you know how to deal wisely in the affairs of life? Because you meditated in the Word of God and walked in the light of that Word.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;" >PRACTICING THE WORD</h2>

<p>Practicing the Word means being a doer of the Word.</p>

<p><strong>JAMES 1:22</strong></p>

<p><strong>22-But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only...</strong></p>


<p>We have many "talkers about the Word," and even many "rejoicers about the Word," but we do not have many "doers of the Word."</p>


<p>Begin to practice being a doer of the Word by doing in all circum-stances what the Word tells you to do.</p>


<p>Some have thought that being a doer of the Word meant to keep the Ten Commandments. That is not what James 1:22 means. After all, under the New Covenant we have but one commandment-the commandment of love. Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13:34).</p>


<p>A doer of the Word will do that. If you love someone, you won't steal from him. You won't lie about him. The New Testament says that love is the fulfilling of the law. If you walk in love you won't break any law that was given to curb sin.</p>


<p>Being a doer of the Word means that we are to do primarily what is written in the Epistles. They are the letters written to us, the Church. As an example of doing the Word, let us look at some instructions given us in one of the Epistles.</p>


<p><strong>PHILIPPIANS 4:6</strong></p>

<p><strong>6-Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong></p>


<p>So do that! Now we don't mind practicing part of this verse-the part that says to pray. But if you practice just that part and not the first part, you are not practicing the Word-you are not a doer of the Word.</p>


<p>The Amplified translation of Philippians 4:6 begins, "Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything...." First we are told not to fret. If you are going to fret and have anxieties, it will do no good to make requests. That kind of praying does not work. An over-anxious prayer full of fretfulness does not work.</p>


<p>I felt very sorry for a minister who came to me some years ago. (But sometimes it doesn't give a man the answer just to sympathize with him.) His life was full of storms and tests. His stomach was upset; he couldn't keep down what he ate. He couldn't sleep. His nerves were shot because of a particular incident.</p>


<p>He came to me for help. I began to tell him what the Word said and how to pray about this circumstance.</p> 


<p>When 1 encouraged him to take this scripture and do it, he rebelled. He said, "Oh, yes, but every-one doesn't have the faith that you have."</p>

<p>I told him it was not a matter of having a lot of faith, but a matter of endeavoring to practice the Word. I told him if he would practice the Word, his faith would be built up. And I told him how I practice this particular verse.</p>



<p>When I get alone, I read this verse aloud and I tell the Lord that His Word is true and that I believe it.</p>


<p>I told this minister that he would be tempted to say he couldn't help worrying and fretting. But that God had not asked us to do something we cannot do. When God said not to fret that means we can keep from fretting and being anxious. God is a just God and He will not ask us to do something we cannot do.</p>


<p>When I first began practicing this verse it was easy to believe that I could make my requests known unto God-but it was hard to believe that I could not fret. However, since God says we don't have to fret, then I would say, "I refuse to fret or have any anxiety about anything."</p>


<p>I tell the Lord that I bring my requests unto Him. Then I thank Him for the answer. This quiets my spirit and pacifies the troubled spirit the devil tries to make me have.</p>


<p>Then I would go about my business. Before I knew it, however, the devil was trying to get me to fret again. I would simply go right back and read this verse again and keep claiming it.</p>


<p>This minister began to practice Philippians 4:6. He told me later that the problem worked out and did not get as big as he was expect-ing. He was about to be sued over a certain matter, but God helped him out of it.</p>


<p>It is possible to become so fretful over something that you cannot sleep. But all you have to do is practice the Word and you will eat or get results.</p>

<p>Philippians 4:7 is a result of practicing Philippians 4:6.</p>


<p><strong>PHILIPPIANS 4:7</strong></p>


<p><strong>7-And the peace of God, which passeth all under-standing, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</strong></p>


<p>Many people want what verse 7 talks about but they don't want to practice what verse 6 says to do to get it. The Amplified translation of verse 7 says, "And God's peace which transcends all under-standing, shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus." God's peace will keep guard over your heart and your mind.</p>


<p>But can you reap these results and have this peace without being a doer of the Word? No, you really cannot.</p>


<p>Verse 6 tells us not to fret. People who worry and fret, continu-ally think on the wrong side of life. Verse 8 tells us what we are to think about.</p>


<p><strong>PHILIPPIANS 4:8</strong></p>


<p><strong>8-Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, what-soever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</strong></p>


<p>DO verse 8. Practice this verse. Think about the right things. Many people think about the wrong things. You know what they think about because of what they talk about.</p>


<p>The Bible says, "... out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh" (Matt. 12:34). They con-tinually worry and fret and think on the wrong side of life and they continually talk unbelief.</p>

<p>You cannot be a doer of the Word and continue to talk unbelief. The more you talk about some things, the bigger they get. If something does not meet all of these qualifica-tions if it is not true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report-do not think about it and do not talk about it!</p>


<p>The Amplified translation of First Corinthians 13:7 reads, "Love... is ever ready to believe the best of every person." I have found through the years that most of the stories I have heard about people do not even meet the first qualification. They are not even true. So don't talk about the stories you hear. Don't even think about them. Some things you hear might even be true-but they might not be pure and lovely, and notice this of a good report. Therefore we are not to think about them.</p>



<p>By thinking about such things, we give place to the devil. His greatest weapon is the power of suggestion. He is ever endeavoring to enter your thought life. That is why we are told in God's Word to, "... think on these things" (Phil. 4:8).</p>


<p>Particularly in the Epistles, God the Holy Spirit is speaking to the Church. So meditate on these letters and what He has to say and be a doer of the Word. You will grow spiritually.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;" >GIVE THE WORD FIRST PLACE</h2>

<p>The training, the developing, the educating of our spirits comes by giving the Word of God first place in our lives.</p>


<p><strong>PROVERBS 4:20-22</strong></p>


<p><strong>20-My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>21-Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</strong></p>

<p><strong>22-For they are life unto those that find them, and health o all their flesh.</strong></p>


<p>God says in this passage, ". Attend to my words [Give heed to them-Put them first]; incline thine ear unto my sayings [Listen to what I have to say]. Let them not 'epart from thine eyes [Keep looking at the Word of God]; keep them [my Words] in... your heart."</p>


<p>There are rich dividends for doing this. Why is it that God tells us to put His Word first, and to listen to what He has to say, to keep looking at His Word, and to keep His Word in our heart? It is because "... they [His Words] are LIFE unto those that find them, and HEALTH to all their flesh."</p>



<p>The margin of the King James says the word translated health is the Hebrew word for medicine. God's Word is "medicine to all their flesh." There is healing in the Word.</p>


<p>In the 12 years I pastored, there were church members who would get sick, go to the hospital, and then ask for prayer. I am not saying it is wrong to have a doctor, certainly not. We believe in hospitals and doctors. Thank God for them. But I am saying, why not put God's Word first? Sometimes as a last resort, Christians will turn to the Word.</p>


<p>A Baptist minister, who didn't even particularly believe in divine healing at the time, told of how he'd had problems with his tonsils. His doctor kept insisting that they be removed. So the date was finally set for his tonsils to be removed.</p>


<p>It was his family's custom to read the Bible and pray together each morning before the children went to school.</p>

<p>On the very day this minister was scheduled to enter the hospital, this family's daily scripture passage was the one which tells of King Asa, who got a dis-ease in his feet and instead of seeking the Lord, he sought physicians and he died (2 Chron. 16:12-13).</p>



<p>The minister said he was struck by this. He realized that he had not even prayed about his tonsils. He shared this with his wife and children and asked that they pray together about his tonsils.</p>



<p>When they prayed, the Lord told him not to have them removed. To his astonishment, the Lord healed the tonsils and he has had no more trouble with them.</p>


<p>There is a lesson to be learned here. The Bible does not imply that King Asa died because he put the physicians first. However, it does imply that he should have put the Lord first. We should train our-selves to put the Lord first.</p>


<p>We should train ourselves to ask ourselves concerning any matter, "What does God's Word have to say about this?" We should ask our-selves what God has to say about anything that may come up in our life and then put that Word first.</p>


<p>Sometimes family and friends will try to rush you into things-but you need to think about what the Word of God says. Put God's Word first in every area of life.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;" >INSTANLY OBEY THE VOICE OF YOUR SPIRIT</h2>


<p>The human spirit has a voice. We call that voice conscience. Some-times we call it intuition, an inner voice, or guidance. The world calls it a hunch. But what it is, is your spirit speaking to you. Every man's spirit, saved or unsaved, has a voice.</p>


<p>The human spirit, as we have seen in previous chapters, is a spiri-tua man, a spirit man, an inward hidden man. He is hidden to the physical senses.</p>

<p>You cannot see him with the physical eyes, nor touch him with your physical hands. This is the man who has become a new creature in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). When a man is born again, his spirit becomes a new spirit.</p>


<p>God prophesied through both Ezekiel and Jeremiah that a time would come when He would take the old stony heart out of men and put in a new one. He said that He would put His Spirit into us. Under the New Covenant, this New Birth became available.</p>


<p>The New Birth is a rebirth of the human spirit. As Second Corinthians 5:17 tells us, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature-everything that was old in his spirit, the old nature, is taken away, and all things have become new.</p>


<p>As you give this newborn spirit the privilege of meditating on the Word of God, the Word becomes the source of its information. Your spirit will become strong and the inward voice of your conscience, educated in the spirit, will become a true guide.</p>


<p>Did you notice that meditation in the Word, practicing the Word, giving the Word first place, all come before obeying your spirit? You see, if your spirit has had the privilege of meditating in the Word, of practicing the Word, of putting the Word first-then your spirit is an authoritative guide.</p>


<p><em>"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord......" </em>(Prov. 20:27). Your newborn spirit has within it the life and nature of God. The Holy Spirit dwells within your spirit. "... greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world" (1 John 4:4). The Holy Spirit dwells in your spirit. God has to communicate with you through your spirit because that is where He is. Your spirit gets its information through Him.</p>


<p>Learn to obey the voice of your spirit.</p>


<p>If you are not accustomed to doing that, of course, you will not get there quickly. As we have said, your spirit can be built up and strengthened just as your body can be built up and strengthened.</p>


<p>Your spirit can be educated just as your mind can be educated. But just as you did not begin school in the first grade one week and graduate from the twelfth grade the next week, your spirit will not be educated and trained overnight.</p>


<p>However, if you will follow these four points and practice them, after a while you can know the will of God the Father even in the minor details of life. You will receive guidance and will always instantly get either a yes or a no. You will know in your spirit what you should do in all the affairs of life.</p>
