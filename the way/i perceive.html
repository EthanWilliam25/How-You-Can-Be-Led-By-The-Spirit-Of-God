 <strong>CHAPTER 22</strong>   
 <p><h1>I Perceive</h1></p>

<p><strong>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Acts 27:9-10</strong></p>

<p>Paul said, "I perceive...." He did not say, I have a revelation. He did not say, the Lord told me. He said, "I perceive."</p>


<p>How did he perceive it?</p>

<p>By the inward witness. He did not perceive it mentally. He did not perceive it physically. In his spirit he had this witness.</p>


<p>A family of seven had gone out to eat. The family had not been at the restaurant very long when the father suddenly said, "Let's go home."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I just have an urge, a perception, that we should"</p>


<p>They rushed home. A fire had started. If they had waited, every. thing would have burned. But the inward witness warned them in time.</p>


<p>If their home had burned down, someone might have said, "God did that. He had some purpose in it."</p>


<p>No, we have missed it because we haven't listened on the inside in our spirits. We have not been spirit-conscious.</p>


<p>You cannot find anywhere in the Bible where God causes these things to happen to teach His people something. If those on that ship had listened to Paul, they could have saved the ship and the mer-chandise. As it was, they lost everything and almost lost their lives. They would have lost their lives, too, if they had not started listening to Paul.</p>


<p>God is not an enemy! He is trying to help us! He is not working against us! He is working for us!</p>


<p>As we become more spirit-conscious we can learn how to better cooperate with Him.</p>


<p><strong>Remember that the primary way God leads His children is by the inward witness.</strong></p>
