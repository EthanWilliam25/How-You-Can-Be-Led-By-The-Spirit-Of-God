<strong>CHAPTER 8</strong>

<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Know-So Salvation</h1>

<p><strong>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself....</strong></p>

<p><strong>-1 John 5:10</strong></p>

<p>For are the sons of God" or as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they (Rom. 8:14). The sons of God can expect to be led by the Spirit of God. Hallelujah! They are not led by someone else telling them what to do. The Holy Spirit is going to lead us. We have Scripture that says so.</p>


<p>How does He lead? Verse 16 gives us a clue: "The Spirit itself [Himself] BEARETH WITNESS with our spirit, that we are the children of God" (Rom. 8:16).</p>


<p>In the most important aspect of life, and in the most important thing that can happen to you becoming a child of God. God lets you know that you are His child by His Spirit bearing witness with your spirit. Then you can understand that the first and foremost way God will lead you is also by that inward witness.</p>


<p>You do not know that you are a child of God because someone prophesied that you are. You wouldn't accept that. You do not know that you are a child of God because someone said, "I feel like you are You wouldn't accept that. You are not a child of God because you had a vision. You might, or you might not have had a vision, but a vision is not what would make you a child of God. That is not what the Bible says. That is not the way you know you are a child of God.</p>


<p>How does the Bible say we know we are children of God? His Spirit, God's Spirit, bears witness with our spirits.</p>


<p>Sometimes you can't really explain how you know you are a child of God, but you just know it, right down on the inside of you. You know it! You know you are by the inward witness.</p>


<p>I was born again as a teenager on the bed of sickness April 22, 1933. Since that day, the thought has never occurred to me that I might not be saved. Yet even as a young Christian I ran into people who said, "You're not saved because you don't belong to our church." Or those who would argue, "You're not saved because you haven't been baptized our way" And many gave me other reasons why they Thought i was not saved.</p>


<p>But none of that disturbed me. I laughed at it, because I had the witness! And I had the love!</p>


<p><strong>1 JOHN 3:14</strong></p>

<p><strong>14-We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love..</strong></p>
