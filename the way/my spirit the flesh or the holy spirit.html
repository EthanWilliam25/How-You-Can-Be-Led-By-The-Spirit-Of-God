    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >My Spirit? The Flesh? Or The Holy Spirit? </h1>

<p><strong>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Proverbs 20:27</strong></p>

<p>Someone might ask, "How can I tell whether it is my own spirit, or the Holy Spirit telling me to do something?"</p>


<p>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.</p>

<p>"But it may just be me wanting to do it."</p>


<p>Define your terms. If by "me" you mean the flesh, of course you cannot always obey the flesh. But if by "me" you mean the inward man, the real you, then it is all right to obey the inward man. Go ahead and do what he wants you to do.</p>

<p>If your spirit is a new creature in Christ Jesus and old things hav passed away and all things are become new, and your spirit has the life and nature of God in it and the Holy Spirit in it, and your spirit is in fellowship with God-it is not going to tell you to do something that is not right. If you are a Spirit-filled Christian, your inward man has the Holy Spirit in His  fullness-- not in measure, but in His fullness--making His home in you.</p>


<p>It is not the inward man of the Christian that wants to do wrong-it is the outward man. You ought to be able to tell whether it is the flesh wanting to do something, or the spirit. Here is a text that has been puzzle to many:</p>


<p><strong>1 JOHN 3:9</strong></p>

<p><strong>9-Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</strong></p>


<p>This is talking about the inward man. Physically we are born of human parents and we partake of their nature. Spiritually we are born of God and partake of His nature. God's nature is not the nature to do wrong.</p>


<p>I have missed it a lot of times as a Christian. But my inward man did not sin. He didn't even agree with me when I did sin. He tried to get me not to do it. My heart wept because I sinned. I allowed my flesh to dominate and I missed it, but my spirit never did consent to it. God's seed is in my spirit, not in my flesh.</p>


<p>If you continue to allow your flesh to dominate you, you will con-tinue to miss it. If you continue to let your natural mind dominate you, and do not get your mind renewed with the Word, you will continue to miss it.</p>


<p>That's why Paul wrote born-again, Spirit-filled Christians at Rome and told them to do two things: First, they were to present their bodies, and second, they were to renew their minds with the Word (Rom. 12:1-2).</p>


<p>Until your mind is renewed with the Word of God, your flesh and your unrenewed mind will dominate your spirit. That will keep you as a baby Christian-a carnal Christian.</p>


<p>Paul said to the church at Corinth. <em>"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ"</em> (1 Cor. 3:1).</p>


<p>"For ye are yet carnal.. " he said (v. 3). One translation says, "For you are yet body-ruled."</p>


<p>Then he told them, "... and [ye] walk as "(v. 3). Another trans-lation says, "Ye walk as mere men." What did he mean? He meant they were walking and doing things just like unsaved men do.</p>


<p>When you get your mind renewed with the Word, then your mind will side in with your spirit instead of with your body. And the two of them-your spirit through your mind will control your body.</p>


<p>My spirit will not tell me something wrong. It has the nature of God in it; it has the life of God in it; it has the love of God in it; and it has the Spirit of God in it.</p>


<p><strong>2 PETER 1:4</strong></p>


<p><strong>4-Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.</strong></p>


<p>We are born of God. The we feed on the word of God. By so doung we are partakers of the divine nature, God's nature If we have the divine nature in us, our spirit will not tell us to do something wrong.</p>


<p><strong>Whatever your spirit tells you will be right.</strong></p>
