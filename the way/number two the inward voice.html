   <h1 style="text-align: center;">Number Two: The Inward Voice</h1>

<p><strong>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Romans 9:1</strong></p>

<p>The number one way the Spirit guides us is through the inwan T witness. Number two is by the inward voice.</p>


<p>The inward man, who is a spirit man, has a voice just as the ou ward man has a voice. We call this voice of the inward man conscien We call this voice the still small voice.</p>


<p>Your spirit has a voice. Your spirit will speak to you.</p>


<p>In September 1966 we moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, from Garlan Texas, a suburb of Dallas. We had lived there 17 years. The move came about like this: My wife and I were in Tulsa on business. The ministry was growing and I had already figured out in my head what I would do with my office and home in Texas to accommodate the growth But a friend with whom we were staying in Tulsa, said, "Brother Hagin, you ought to move to Tulsa. Brother T.L. Osborn's old office building is for sale. His business manager asked me to sell it for them." Then he quoted their price. It was extremely low. But | was not interested. Finally, he said, "Let's go look at it." I went along just to humor him.</p>


<p>The minute I stood inside that building a buzzer went off inside of me. (Sometimes that inward witness is so real it can almost sound like an inward "buzzer.") I knew as well as I knew my name, this is it! But I didn't want to listen to it; I wanted to stay in Garland.</p>


<p>(That's why we don't hear a lot of times. We don't want to hear. We say we do, but we don't.)</p>


<p>Back at our friend's home, my wife asked me about the building. "Oh, no. I've already got it all figured out. We'll stay where we are. We'll turn our whole home into an office. And we'll just stay in Garland."</p>


<p>We went to bed that night, but I couldn't sleep.</p>


<p>Ordinarily, I have no trouble sleeping. The Bible says, "... he giveth his beloved sleep" (Ps. 127:2). I am His beloved. So are you. "... he hath made us accepted in the beloved" (Eph. 1:6). So I always claim the promise of God and say, "Lord, I'm Your beloved. So I take You at Your Word. I thank You for sleep." And I always go to sleep.</p>


<p>But this time, I couldn't. My conscience was hurting. My con-science is the voice of my spirit. My spirit knows I didn't listen to it.</p>


<p>Lying there quietly in the nighttime, I said, "Lord, if you want me to move to Tulsa I will. In the natural,  I don't want to move there but I wouldn't want to stand in Your way"</p>


<p>Then on the inside of me I heard the still small voice. Now I'm not talking about the Spirit of God speaking. When the Holy Spirit speaks it is more authoritative. The still small voice is the voice of our own spirit speaking. But our own spirit picks it up from the Holy Spirit Who is in us.</p>


<p>That still small voice, that inward voice, not authoritative, just some-thing on the inside of me said, "I am going to give you that building."</p>


<p>I laughed. I know there is a lot of unbelief about this, but I said, "Okay. When you do, I'll believe it."</p>


<p>That inward voice, picking up on what the Holy Spirit was saying, said, "You watch me."</p>


<p>Without going into all the details, it would surprise you how God gave us that building.</p>


<p>[Brother Hagin gives further details of his move to Tulsa in Appendix 3.-Ed.] </p>
