  <strong>CHAPTER 29</strong> 
  <p><h1>Praying In The Spirit </h1></p>

<p><strong>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then?

I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</strong></p>


<p><strong>-1 Corinthians 14:14-15</strong></p>


<p>The Lord enlightens us and guides us through our spirits. If that The be the case and it is then we need to become more spirit-conscious. We need to become more conscious of the fact that we are spirit beings, and not just mental or physical beings. We need to train our spirits so they will become safer and safer guides.</p>


<p>One of the greatest spiritual exercises there is, is to pray in tongues every single day. Your spirit is then in direct contact with the Father of spirits.</p>

<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 14:2</strong></p>


<p><strong>2-For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understand-eth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</strong></p>


<p>It is your spirit praying when you pray in tongues the Holy Ghost gives the utterance, but it is your spirit praying. Paul said, "For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth..." (1 Cor. 14:14).</p>


<p>I have always followed the policy of daily praying in tongues. It keeps my spirit in contact with the Father of spirits. It helps me become more spirit-conscious.</p>


<p>When you pray in tongues, your mind grows quiet-because you are not praying out of your mind. And once your mind is quiet, you become more conscious of your own spirit, and of spiritual things.</p>


<p>Get out of the sense realm. Get out of the flesh realm. Get out of the human reasoning realm.</p>


<p>Get over into the faith realm and into the spirit realm. Faith is of the spirit-and that's where great things happen!</p>
