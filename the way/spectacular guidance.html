<p><strong>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.</strong></p>


<p><strong>-Acts 26:19</strong></p>


<p>God leads us today just like He led the first Christians. His Word G works now just like it did then. It has not changed. The Spirit of God has not changed. God does not change.</p>


<p>The early believers did not have one Church back then, and we have another Church now. We have made a mistake in thinking that. We are in the same age they were in the Church Age. We are in the same Church. We have the same Holy Spirit. It has seemed to us, however, that they had a whole lot we don't have. Not so.</p>


<p>"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God"</p>


<p>(Rom. 8:14). There are sons of God today. And the Spirit of God is still leading sons of God.</p>

<p>So we look into the Acts of the Apostles and elsewhere in the Bible to see how the Spirit of God led them. At times some received guid. ance through a vision. Others received guidance from an angel who appeared and told them what to do.</p>


<p>Such phenomena, however, did not happen every day in these people's lives. They occurred once or twice in a lifetime for most So these are not the ordinary ways God leads. We get the impression that nearly every day an angel appeared to someone and told them something. That is not so.</p>


<p>Too many times while God is trying to bear witness with our spirit, trying to guide us the way He said He would in His Word, we do not listen because we want something such as a vision or an angel to appear.</p>


<p>We have no right to seek a vision. We have no right to ask for an angel. There are no scriptures which say that we should. We do have a right to claim what the Bible promises. If God wants to send an angel, fine. If He wants to give a vision, fine.</p>


<p>As a young minister I did the same thing most Christians have done in the babyhood stage of their Christianity. I heard people talk-ing about visions and angels, and I prayed something like that would happen to me. It never did.</p>


<p>Then I matured spiritually so that I never expected it to happen.</p>


<p>I did not pray that it would happen. I did not expect it. But back in 1949, I was praying one day in the last church I pastored. I had shut myself up in the church to wait on God because I had a wit-ness in my spirit that I should do so. Then the Holy Spirit-not my spirit-spoke to me.</p>


<p>Before I tell you what He said, look at the following passage scripture with me and see how Peter saw a vision and then was led by the voice of the Spirit of God:</p>

<p><strong>ACTS 10:9-11</strong></p>


<p><strong>9-On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray about the sixth hour:</strong></p>


<p><strong>10-And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</strong></p>


<p><strong>11-And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth.</strong></p>


<p>God showed Peter through a vision that He was going to bring in the Gentiles. Now we will skip to verse 19:</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 10:19-20</strong></p>


<p><strong>19-While Peter thought on the vision, THE SPIRIT SAID unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</strong></p>


<p><strong>20-Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</strong></p>


<p>These were three men from Cornelius' household. After Peter went to Cornelius' house in Caesarea and preached to these Gentiles, he went up to Jerusalem where the Bible says, "... they that were of the circumcision contended with him" (Acts 11:2). In Acts chapter 11, Peter is rehearsing what had happened to him in Acts chapter 10.</p>


<p><strong>ACTS 11:11-12</strong></p>


<p><strong>11-And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</strong></p>


<p><strong>12-AND THE SPIRIT BADE ME GO with them, nothing doubting..</strong></p>

    
    <p>The Holy Spirit spoke to Peter. It may have been that Peter looked around to see who had spoken to him, I don't know. But he knew that the Spirit of God bade him go.</p>


<p>The Spirit spoke to me as I was waiting there in my church The Holy Spirit said, "I am going to take you on to revelations and visions."</p>


<p>Immediately, revelations, in line with the Word-I'm not talking about something out of line with the Bible-began to come. Then in 1950 the visions began to come. Jesus Himself appeared to me and talked to me on various occasions. There were also other visions. </p>
