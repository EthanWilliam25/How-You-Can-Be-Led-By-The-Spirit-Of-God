    <strong>CHAPTER 3</strong>
    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Spirit-Conscious </h1>

<p><strong>I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-1 Thessalonians 5:23</strong></p>

<p>In this scriptural passage, Paul begins with the inside, the innermost I part of man, the heart of his being, which is his spirit, and comes to the outside.</p>

<p>Yet most people misquote this verse. They say, "body, soul, and spirit." Why do they put the body first? Because they are more body-conscious than spirit-conscious. Natural things mean more to them than spiritual things. So they put physical things first.</p>

<p>Sometimes we are more mental-conscious because we live more in the mental realm. But man is a spirit being. We need to be spirit-conscious. Spiri-tual things will become more real to us the more spirit-conscious we become.</p>

<p>If we are going to be led by the Spirit of God, we must become more spirit-conscious, or we'll miss out on the whole thing. God's Spirit leads us through our spirits.</p>

<p>Put spirit first. Become more spirit-conscious, more conscious of the inward man. Realize that you are a spirit being and that you became a new creation re-created by God in Christ Jesus. It will help you grow-spiritually.</p>

<p>Many years ago I began to think like this, and at first I would say it to myself out loud: I am a spirit being. I have a soul. And I live in a body.</p>


<p>Saying that helped me become more spirit-conscious. It helped my faith, because faith is of the spirit, or the heart.</p>
