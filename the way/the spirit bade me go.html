    <strong>CHAPTER 24</strong>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;" >The Spirirt Bade Me Go</h1>

<p><strong>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers;

as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, THE HOLY GHOST SAID, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Acts 13:1-2</strong></p>

<p>The Holy Ghost said. It would be of interest, first of all, to notice under what conditions the Holy Ghost said something. "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said...."</p>

<p>I am convinced we need to have services where we minister to the Lord. Too often we just minister to one another. Bible studies are good; we need them. Special singing is fine. But too many times we are not singing to the Lord; we are singing to the congregation. Let's have some services where we minister to the Lord; where we wait on Him. In that kind of an atmosphere the Holy Ghost can speak to us.</p>


<p>This was a group of five ministers. I do not know how the Holy Ghost spoke to them. It could have been that one of the prophets spoke it out. Of this I am sure they all heard and they all agreed that the Holy Ghost was talking.</p>


<p><em>The Holy Ghost said, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them"</em> (Acts 13:2).</p>


<p>Peter said, "... <em>The Spirit bade me go.</em> "(Acts 11:12). After I had been in the ministry many years, death came and fastened itself upon my body. I know when death comes; I have been dead twice and came back. I know how it feels. Actually, I started to fall into the arms of death, when the Spirit of God came on me and lifted me up.</p>


<p>I heard a Voice speak. To me it was audible. I believe it was Jesus. I know that it was the Holy Spirit speaking. We discussed earlier how the Holy Ghost speaks not of Himself, but whatever He hears, that shall He speak. So the Holy Spirit heard God or Jesus say this, and He repeated it.</p>


<p>It sounded like a man's voice. It said, "Thou shalt not die, but thou shalt live. I want you to go teach My people faith. I have taught you faith through My Word. I have permitted you to go through certain experiences. You have learned faith both through My Word and by experience. Now go teach My people what I have taught you. Go teach My people faith."</p>


<p>The moment that voice ceased speaking I was perfectly well.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to be obedient to that heavenly Voice. That is the reason I teach faith so much-1 am supposed to do it.</p>


<p>I will refer again now to the time Jesus appeared to me in 1959 in El Paso, Texas. It was during this vision that He told me, "Go teach My people how to be led by My Spirit." I have been dilatory about going to do more teaching on this from now on. This this. But I am is the reason for this book.</p>
