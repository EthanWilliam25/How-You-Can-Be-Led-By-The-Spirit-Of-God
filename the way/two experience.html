    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Two Experience</h1>

<p><strong>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them... when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women... Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:


(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them:

only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Acts 8:5,12,14-17</strong></p>

<p>Under the New Covenant every child of God has the Spirit of God. If you are born again, the Spirit of God is in your spirit.</p>

<p>We do need to differentiate between being born of the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit. The born-again Christian can be filled with the same Spirit that he already has in him. And when he is filled with that Spirit, there will be an overflowing. He will speak with other tongues as the Spirit gives him utterance (Acts 2:4).</p>


<p>Bible scholars know that water is a type of the Spirit of God. Jesus Himself used water as a type of the Spirit. He used it as a type of the New Birth when talking to the woman at the well of Samaria.</p>


<p><strong>JOHN 4:10-11,13-14</strong></p>


<p><strong>10-Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11-The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</strong></p>

<p><strong>13-Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drin-keth of this water shall thirst again:</strong></p>

<p><strong>14-But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlast-ing life.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus also used water as a type of the Spirit in the infilling of the Holy Spirit:</p>

<p><strong>JOHN 7:37-39</strong></p>

<p><strong>37-In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</strong></p>

<p><strong>38-He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</strong></p>


<p><strong>39-(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</strong></p>


<p>These are two different experiences. The New Birth is a well of water in you, springing up into everlasting life. The infilling of the Holy Spirit is rivers-not just one river. The water in the well is for one purpose. The water in the well is for your own benefit. It blesses you. The water in the rivers is for another purpose. The rivers flowing out of you bless someone else.</p>


<p>Some people say, "If you are born of the Spirit, you have the Spirit, and that's all there is." But, no, just because you have had one drink of water is no sign you're full of water. There is the experience sub-sequent to the New Birth of being filled with the Spirit-and as a result, out of the belly (the innermost being the spirit) rivers of living water can flow,</p>


<p>Others say that people who are not filled with the Spirit speaking with other tongues do not have the Holy Spirit. That is not true. If I drink half a glass of water, I may not be full, but at least I have water in me. If one is born of the Spirit of God, he has the Spirit of God abiding in him. </p>
